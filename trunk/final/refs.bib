                  artificial intelligence. It includes as special

                  decoding algorithm. Although this algorithm is
                  guaranteed to give exact answers only in certain
                  cases (the "junction tree" condition), unfortunately
                  not including the cases of GTW with cycles or turbo
                  decoding, there is much experimental evidence, and a
                  few theorems, suggesting that it often works

  Abstract =	 {We investigate several basic problems in vision
                  under the assumption that the observer is active. An
                  observer is called active when engaged in some kind
                  of activity whose purpose is to control the
                  geometric parameters of the sensory apparatus. The
                  purpose of the activity is to manipulate the
                  constraints underlying the observed phenomena in
                  order to improve the quality of the perceptual
                  results. For example a monocular observer that moves
                  with a known or unknown motion or a binocular
                  observer that can rotate his eyes and track
                  environmental objects are just two examples of an
                  observer that we call active. We prove that an
                  active observer can solve basic vision problems in a
                  much more efficient way than a passive one. Problems
                  that are ill-posed and nonlinear for a passive
                  observer become well-posed and linear for an active
                  observer. In particular, the problems of shape from
                  shading and depth computation, shape from contour,
                  shape from texture, and structure from motion are
                  shown to be much easier for an active observer than
                  for a passive one. It has to be emphasized that
                  correspondence is not used in our approach, i.e.,
                  active vision is not correspondence of features from
                  multiple viewpoints. Finally, active vision here
                  does not mean active sensing, and this paper
                  introduces a general methodology, a general
                  framework in which we believe low-level vision
                  problems should be addressed.},
  r-Clark92chapter ={Aloimonos et al showed that camera motion can be
                  used to make a vision problem that is ill-posed in
                  the single image case into a well posed one},
  r-Edelman08chapter ={Both the feasibility of and the need for an
                  explicit and sweeping reconstruction of the geometry
                  of the visual world have been subsequently
                  questioned (Aloimonos et al., 1988; Bajcsy,
                  1988). Noting that biological vision is purposive
                  and active, researchers proposed that computer
                  vision too should aim at serving certain well-dened
                  goals such as navigation or recognition rather than
                  at constructing a general-purpose representation of

                  computationally cheap bounds for the minimum
                  degree. We show that these bounds are often equal to
                  the actual degree. The resulting algorithm is
                  typically much faster than previous minimum degree
                  ordering algorithms and produces results that are
                  comparable in quality with the best orderings from
                  other minimum degree algorithms.},

                  landmarks and scene layout information for the
                  control of locomotion. Observers were presented
                  displays simulating forward locomotion through a
                  random dot field with the horizontal position
                  perturbed by a sum-of-sines function and were asked
                  to steer and null out the horizontal disturbance of
                  the path of locomotion. The results indicate greater
                  control gain and accuracy when presented with a
                  repeating layout of landmarks as compared to a
                  changing layout of landmarks. Debriefing responses
                  suggest that observers may have implicitly learned
                  the layout of the repeating pattern. These results
                  suggest that observers use an allocentric
                  representation of the scene for steering control. A
                  model for the control of locomotion is discussed
                  that utilizes both scene-based information and optic

                  framework captures shape, color, and motion
                  properties of door and wall objects. The
                  probabilistic model is optimized with a version of
                  the expectation maximization algorithm, which
                  segments the environment into door and wall objects

                  the robot to generalize the properties of detected
                  object instances to new object instances. We
                  demonstrate the algorithm on real-world data

                  vision-based, reactive robot navigation that enables
                  a robot to move in the middle of the free space by
                  exploiting both central and peripheral vision. The
                  robot employs a forward-looking camera for central
                  vision and two side-looking cameras for sensing the
                  periphery of its visual field. The developed method
                  combines the information acquired by this trinocular
                  vision system and produces low-level motor commands
                  that keep the robot in the middle of the free
                  space. The approach follows the purposive vision
                  paradigm in the sense that vision is not studied in
                  isolation but in the context of the behaviors that
                  the system is engaged as well as the environment and
                  the robot's motor capabilities. It is demonstrated
                  that by taking into account these issues, vision
                  processing can be drastically simplified still
                  giving rise to quite complex behaviors. The proposed
                  method does not make strict assumptions about the
                  environment, requires very low level information to
                  be extracted from the images, produces a robust
                  robot behavior and is computationally
                  efficient. Results obtained by bath simulations and
                  from a prototype on-line implementation demonstrate
                  the effectiveness of the method},

  journal =	 {Robotics and Autonomous Systems},

  Abstract =	 {Artificial navigation systems stand to benefit
                  greatly from learning maps of visual environments,
                  but traditional map-making techniques are inadequate
                  in several respects. This paper describes an
                  adaptive, view-based, relational map-making system
                  for navigating within a 3D environment defined by a
                  spatially distributed set of visual
                  landmarks. Inspired by an analogy to learning aspect
                  graphs of 3D objects, the system comprises two
                  neurocomputational architectures that emulate
                  cognitive mapping in the rat hippocampus. The first
                  architecture performs unsupervised place learning by
                  combining the ?hat?with the ?here? namely through
                  conjunctions of landmark identity, pose, and
                  egocentric gaze direction within a local, restricted
                  sensory view of the environment. The second
                  associatively learns action consequences by
                  incorporating the ?hen? namely through conjunctions
                  of learned places and coarsely coded robot
                  motions. Together, these networks form a map
                  reminiscent of a partially observable Markov
                  decision process, and consequently provide an ideal
                  neural substrate for prediction, environment
                  recognition, route planning, and
                  exploration. Preliminary results from real-time
                  implementations on a mobile robot called MAVIN (the

                  strategies for perception. By modeling we mean
                  models of sensors, processing modules and their
                  interaction. We distinguish local models from global
                  models by their extent of application in space and
                  time. The local models represent procedures and
                  parameters such as optical distortions of the lens,
                  focal lens, spatial resolution, band-pass filter,
                  etc. The global models on the other hand

                  predictions on how the individual modules
                  interact. The control strategies are formulated as a
                  search of such sequence of steps that would minimize
                  a loss function while one is seeking the most
                  information. Examples are shown as the existence
                  proof of the proposed theory on obtaining range from

                  management of many simultaneous tasks, such as
                  walking on a sidewalk, avoiding pedestrians, and
                  crossing busy streets. The management of
                  simultaneous tasks has been studied extensively, but
                  those studies tend to focus on attentional loading
                  in reaction time experiments that use stimulus
                  presentations of less than one second. As a result,
                  little is known about how attention is managed in
                  extended natural tasks that take on the order of
                  many minutes. The current study addresses the
                  extended allocation of visual attention. We study
                  the gaze control and locomotion control for a
                  virtual humanoid agent walking in a realistic
                  simulated urban world. The agent��? behaviors are
                  directed by visuo-motor routines that each handle a
                  single well-defined task, such as staying on the
                  sidewalk or avoiding an obstacle. The key element in
                  our model is that behaviors ask for and are given
                  access to the body on a probabilistic basis. The
                  probabilities are continually adjusted to reflect
                  the contingencies produced by the environment. The
                  gaze access period is adjusted to reflect the modal
                  time of human fixations in similar tasks. The
                  locomotion access period is adjusted to fit human
                  performance data. Such a model can explain how
                  different behaviors can compete for both eye gaze
                  resources in addition to locomotion resources of the
                  body in a seamless manner. In our simulation, the
                  humanoid walks along a crowded sidewalk and crosses
                  streets. During this time the instantaneous
                  allocation of resources to gaze and ambulation are
                  recorded. To test our model, we have human subjects
                  doing the same task. Humans wear head-mounted
                  displays that allow them to navigate in the same
                  virtual environment. Six-dof head-tracking as well
                  as eye-tracking in the HMD allows us to compare the
                  use of gaze and locomotion by the human subjects
                  with our model. Our initial results suggest that the
                  probabilistic allocation of resources is a good fit
                  to the human data.},

                  computation can be vastly less expensive when
                  considered in the larger context of behavior. The
                  most important visual behavior is the ability to
                  control the direction of gaze. This allows the use
                  of very low resolution imaging that has a high
                  virtual resolution. Using such a system in a
                  controlled way provides additional constraints that
                  dramatically simplify the computations of early
                  vision. Another important behavior is the way the
                  environment "behaves." Animate systems under
                  real-time constraints can further reduce their
                  computational burden by using environmental cues
                  that are perspicuous in the local context. A third
                  source of economy is introduced when behaviors are
                  learned. Because errors are rarely fatal, systems
                  using learning algorithms can amortize computational
                  cost over extended periods. Further economies can be
                  achieved when the learning system uses indexical
                  reference, which is a form of dynamic variable
                  binding. Animate vision is a natural way of
                  implementing this dynamic binding.},

                  control the direction of gaze. ..[Animate vision]
                  argues that vision is more readily understood in the
                  context of the visual behaviors that the system is
                  engaged in, and that these behaviors may not require
                  elaborate categorical representations of the 3-D
                  world. .. The human eye is distinguished from
                  current electronic cameras by virtue of having much
                  better resolution in a small region near the optical
                  axis. .. With the small fovea at a premium in a
                  large visual field, it is not surprising that the
                  human visual system has special behaviors (saccades)
                  for quickly moving the fovea to different spatial
                  targets. .. Furthermore most of the brain structures
                  that represent visual information are retinally
                  indexed. This means that their state is changed with
                  each eye movement This raises a technical puzzle for
                  human visual perception: How can the world appear to
                  be stable when the data collecting process is so
                  dynamic? We believe that this is a profound question
                  with a surprising answer: The visual system provides
                  the illusion of three-dimensional stability by
                  virtue of being able to execute fast
                  behaviors. .. The central asset of animate vision is
                  gaze control. Gaze control is the collection of
                  different mechanisms for keeping the fovea over a
                  given spatial target. The single most distinguishing
                  feature of the human visual system is its high-speed
                  gaze control mechanisms. .. Gaze control mechanisms
                  fundamentally change computational models of
                  vision. [] With them a new paradigm emerges in which
                  the visual calculations are embedded in a
                  sensory-motor behavioral repertoire. .. This
                  viewpoint has many different kinds of advantages. 1)
                  Animate vision systems can use physical
                  search. []. 2) Animate vision can make
                  (approximately) known camera movements. []. 3)
                  Animate vision can use exocentric coordinate
                  frames. [] 4) Animate vision can use relative (or
                  qualitative) algorithms. [] 5) Gaze control can
                  segment areas of interest in the image
                  pre-categorically. [] 6) Animate systems can exploit
                  environmental context. [] 7) Animate vision is
                  tailor-made/or learning algorithms that use
                  indexical reference. .. We further suggest that very
                  different algorithms are used depending on the task
                  of the moment. A gross distinction that can be made
                  is between identification algorithms that analyze
                  the foveated area during fixation and location
                  algorithms that direct the eyes to new
                  targets. .. Why should the primate brain be
                  specialized into two separate areas that are crucial
                  for different functions? If we think generally about
                  the problem of relating internal models to objects
                  in the world, then one way to interpret this
                  dichotomy is as a suggestion that the general
                  problem of associating many models to many parts of
                  the image simultaneously is too difficult. In order
                  to make it computationally tractable within a single
                  fixation, it has to be simplified, either into one
                  of location (one internal model) or identification
                  (one world object).},

                  through free-space regions detected in a cluttered
                  environment. The structure of 3-space is recovered
                  modulo an affine transformation using an
                  uncalibrated active stereo head carried by the
                  vehicle. The plane at infinity, necessary for
                  recovering affine structure from projective
                  structure, is found in a novel manner by making
                  controlled rotations of the head. The structure is
                  composed of 3D points obtained by detecting and
                  matching image corners through the stereo image

  abstract =	 {A map is a description of an environment allowing an
                  agent---a human, or in our case a mobile robot---to
                  plan and perform effective actions. From a single
                  location, an agent's sensors can not observe the
                  whole structure of a complex, large environment. For
                  this reason, the agent must build a map from
                  observations gathered over time and space. We
                  distinguish between large-scale space, with spatial
                  structure larger than the agent's sensory horizon,
                  and small-scale space, with structure within the
                  sensory horizon. We propose a factored approach to
                  mobile robot map-building that handles qualitatively
                  different types of uncertainty by combining the
                  strengths of topological and metrical
                  approaches. Our framework is based on a
                  computational model of the human cognitive map; thus
                  it allows robust navigation and communication within
                  several different spatial ontologies. Our approach
                  factors the mapping problem into natural sub-goals:
                  building a metrical representation for local
                  small-scale spaces; finding a topological map that
                  represents the qualitative structure of large-scale
                  space; and (when necessary) constructing a metrical
                  representation for large-scale space using the
                  skeleton provided by the topological map. The core
                  contributions of this thesis are a formal
                  description of the Hybrid Spatial Semantic Hierarchy
                  (HSSH), a framework for both small-scale and
                  large-scale representations of space, and an
                  implementation of the HSSH that allows a robot to
                  ground the large-scale concepts of place and path in
                  a metrical model of the local surround. Given
                  metrical models of the robot's local surround, we
                  argue that places at decision points in the world
                  can be grounded by the use of a primitive called a
                  gateway. Gateways separate different regions in
                  space and have a natural description at
                  intersections and in doorways. We provide an
                  algorithmic definition of gateways, a theory of how
                  they contribute to the description of paths and
                  places, and practical uses of gateways in spatial
                  mapping and learning. },

                  optimization problem into a sequence of smaller
                  subproblems. For classical problems, there is a
                  logical order to this sequence, and each subproblem
                  involves only two variables. Nonserial dynamic
                  programming is a generalization of this; typically
                  the decomposition yields subproblems involving three

                  the sequence of these subproblems, but the principle

                  and order the sequence of subproblems so as to
                  minimize the computational effort. Throughout,
                  extensive use is made of graph theory.},

                  serial structure that allows the use of dynamic
                  programming technique. Decomposition can be
                  tried. The optimization problem obtained is called a
                  secondary optimization problem. Let $G=(X,E)$ be an
                  undirected graph without self-loops and parallel
                  edges. Given $x\in X$, the set $T(x)$ is the set of
                  vertices adjacent to $x$. Consider a vertex $y\in
                  X$. The graph obtained from $G$ by (1) deleting $y$
                  and all edges emanating from it and (2) putting an
                  edge between all the pairs of vertices not adjacent
                  in $G$ is called the $y$-elimination graph of $G$
                  and denoted by $G_y$. The operation is called the
                  elimination of the vertex $y$. Call the degree of an
                  eliminated vertex $y_i$ in a given order of
                  elimination $y_1,y_2,\cdots,y_M$ the dimension
                  associated with the elimination of the vertex
                  $y_i$. The largest degree of the eliminated vertices
                  for an order of elimination $y_1,y_2,\cdots,y_M$ is
                  called the dimension of the order and denoted by
                  $D(y_1,y_2,\cdots,y_M)$. The minimal dimension for
                  all possible orders is called the dimension of the
                  graph $G$ and denoted by $D(G)$. The following
                  problem is discussed: Find an ordering of
                  $y_1,y_2,\cdots,y_M$ of $X$ which minimizes
                  $D(y_1,y_2,\cdots,y_M)$. This is exactly the
                  secondary optimization problem which can be solved
                  considering only the interaction graph of the
                  non-serial problem. There are two algorithms known
                  to solve the secondary optimization problem but they
                  are restricted to problems with 15--20 variables
                  only. Based on two theorems proved in this paper,
                  further computational possibilities are presented,
                  although no formal algorithm is given. The
                  computational significance of the theorems is
                  discussed and demonstrated by some simple
                  examples. Reviewed by D. Hochstadter},

                  respect to the map of the environment. The algorithm
                  makes efficient use of our representation of the
                  landmarks by complex numbers. The algorithm runs in
                  time linear in the number of landmarks. We present

                  value of $N$ the problem is known to be most
                  difficult when $\alpha=M/N$ is close to the
                  experimental threshold $\alpha_c$ separating the
                  region where almost all formulas are SAT from the
                  region where all formulas are UNSAT. Recent results
                  from a statistical physics analysis suggest that the
                  difficulty is related to the existence of a
                  clustering phenomenon of the solutions when $\alpha$
                  is close to (but smaller than) $\alpha_c$. We
                  introduce a new type of message-passing algorithm
                  which can be used to find efficiently a satisfying
                  assignment of the variables in this difficult
                  region. This algorithm is iterative and composed of
                  two main parts. The first is a message-passing
                  procedure which generalizes the usual methods like
                  sum-product and belief propagation: It passes
                  messages that may be thought of as surveys over
                  clusters of ordinary messages. The second part uses
                  the detailed probabilistic information obtained from
                  the surveys in order to fix variables and simplify
                  the problem. Eventually, the simplified problem that
                  remains is solved by a conventional heuristic.},

                  of a recursive algorithm to a sequence of images of
                  a moving object to estimate both its structure and
                  kinematics. The object is assumed to be rigid, and
                  its motion is assumed to be smooth in the sense that
                  it can be modeled by retaining an arbitrary number
                  of terms in the appropriate Taylor series
                  expansions. Translational motion involves a standard
                  rectilinear model, while rotational motion is
                  described with quaternions. Neglected terms of the
                  Taylor series are modeled as process noise. A
                  state-space model is constructed, incorporating both
                  kinematic and structural states, and recursive
                  techniques are used to estimate the state vector as
                  a function of time. A set of object match points is
                  assumed to be available. The problem is formulated
                  as a parameter estimation and tracking problem which
                  can use an arbitrarily large number of images in a
                  sequence. The recursive estimation is done using an
                  iterated extended Kalman filter (IEKF), initialized
                  with the output of a batch algorithm run on the
                  first few frames. Approximate Cramer-Rao lower
                  bounds on the error covariance of the batch estimate
                  are used as the initial state estimate error

                  three-dimensional moving object to estimate both its
                  structure and kinematics. The object is assumed to
                  be rigid, and its motion is assumed to be smooth. A
                  set of object match points is assumed to be
                  available, consisting of fixed features on the
                  object, the image plane coordinates of which have
                  been extracted from successive images in the
                  sequence. Structure is defined as the 3-D positions
                  of these object feature points, relative to each
                  other. Rotational motion occurs about the origin of
                  an object-centered coordinate system, while

                  points for the individual robots so that they
                  simultaneously explore different regions of their
                  environment. We present a probabilistic approach for
                  the coordination of multiple robots which, in
                  contrast to previous approaches, simultaneously
                  takes into account the costs of reaching a target
                  point and the utility of target points. The utility
                  of target points is given by the size of the
                  unexplored area that a robot can cover with its
                  sensors upon reaching a target position. Whenever a

                  process: the eyes move through an evolving sequence
                  of fixations to explore the visual world, and to
                  selectively gather information critical to the task
                  at hand. Computer vision systems must follow similar
                  smart sensing strategies if they are to perform
                  useful tasks in real time. Through intelligent
                  selection of data at an early analysis stage,
                  systems can reduce the overall computational cost by
                  orders of magnitude. Through smart sensing a vision
                  system makes efficient use of limited computing
                  resources. We have built a machine, based on a
                  pyramid architecture, that supports smart sensing
                  and related highly efficient processing. Key
                  elements of the design are a) hierarchical data
                  structures for image representation, b)
                  fine-to-coarse algorithms for the fast generation of
                  image measures, c) coarse-tofine search strategies
                  that rapidly locate objects or events within a
                  scene, and d) high level control mechanisms that
                  guide data gathering even as visual information is
                  being interpreted. This system, known as the Pyramid
                  Vision Machine, achieves high performance at modest
                  cost. Design considerations and several applications
                  are described here.},

                  Chmurzynski (1964), and most recently Gould (1986)
                  suggest that insects have maps of their terrain
                  which enable them to find their way directly to a
                  goal when they are displaced several hundred metres
                  from it. This paper discusses what might constitute
                  an insect's map in terms of a two-part computational
                  model. The first part describes how an insect
                  reaches a goal when the insect is sufficiently close
                  that it can see some of the landmarks which are
                  visible from the goal. The second part considers the
                  problem of navigating when there is no similarity
                  between the view from the release-site and the view
                  from the goal. We start from a model designed to
                  explain how a bee might return to a goal using a
                  two-dimensional snapshot of the landscape seen from
                  the goal (Collett and Cartwright 1983). To guide its
                  return, the model bee continuously compares its
                  snapshot with its current retinal image and moves so
                  as to reduce the discrepancy between the two. Bees
                  can only be guided in the right direction by the
                  difference between current retinal image and
                  snapshot when there is some resemblance between the
                  two. In a realistically cluttered world, snapshot
                  and retinal image become very dissimilar only a
                  short distance from the goal. To increase the
                  distance from which a model bee can return, the bee
                  takes two snapshots at the goal. The first snapshot
                  excludes landmarks near to the goal and the second
                  snapshot includes them. With close landmarks
                  filtered from both snapshot and retinal image, the
                  match between the two deteriorates gradually as the
                  bee moves away from the goal. A model bee using a
                  filtered snapshot and image finds its way back to
                  the neighbourhood of the goal from a relatively long
                  distance (Fig. 2). The bee then switches to the
                  second snapshot and is guided to the precise spot by
                  its memory of the close landmarks. For longer range
                  guidance, the model bee is equipped with an album of
                  snapshots, each taken at a different location within
                  the terrain. Linked to each snapshot is a vector
                  encoding the distance and direction from the place
                  where the snapshot was taken to the hive. When the
                  bee is displaced to a new position, it selects the
                  snapshot which best matches its current image and
                  follows the associated home-vector back to the hive
                  (Fig. 3). Such a hive-centred map can also be used
                  to devise novel routes to places other than the
                  hive. For instance, a bee can reach a foraging site
                  from anywhere in its terrain by adding the
                  home-vector recalled at the starting position to a
                  vector specifying the distance and direction of the
                  foraging site from the hive. The sum of these two
                  vectors defines a direct trajectory to the foraging
                  site.},

  Abstract =	 {A distributed multitarget tracking problem is
                  considered. The joint probabilistic data association
                  (JPDA) algorithm, which has been successfully used
                  for tracking multiple targets in a cluttered
                  environment, assumes a centralized processing
                  architecture. It assumes that measurements are
                  transmitted to a central site and processed. In some
                  applications, however, it may be desirable for the
                  sensor measurements to be processed at or near the
                  sensors instead of transmitting them to the central
                  processor. The local processed results are then sent
                  over a communication network to be used by other
                  processors. This paper presents a distributed
                  version of the JPDA algorithm which is applicable

                  three-dimensional structure and motion causally, in
                  real time from monocular sequences of images. We
                  prove that the algorithm is minimal and stable, in
                  the sense that the estimation error remains bounded
                  with probability one throughout a sequence of
                  arbitrary length. We discuss a scheme for handling
                  occlusions (point features appearing and
                  disappearing) and drift in the scale factor. These
                  issues are crucial for the algorithm to operate in
                  real time on real scenes. We describe in detail the
                  implementation of the algorithm, which runs on a
                  personal computer and has been made available to the
                  community. We report the performance of our
                  implementation on a few representative long
                  sequences of real and synthetic images. The
                  algorithm, which has been tested extensively over
                  the course of the past few years, exhibits honest
                  performance when the scene contains at least 20-40

  abstract =	 {This paper presents a strategy for achieving
                  practical mapping navigation using a wheels driven
                  robot equipped with a sonarray (an advanced sonar
                  array). The original mapping navigation experiment,
                  carried out with the same robot configuration,
                  builds a feature map consisting of commonplace
                  indoor landmarks crucial for localisation, namely
                  planes, corners and edges. The map exhaustively
                  maintains covariance matrices among all features,
                  thus presents a time and memory impediment to
                  practical navigation in large environments. The new
                  local mapping strategy proposed here breaks down a
                  large environment into a topology of local regions,
                  only maintaining the covariance among features in
                  the same local region, and the covariance among
                  local maps. This notion of two hierarchy
                  representation drastically improves the memory and
                  processing time requirements of the original global
                  approach, while preserving the statistical details
                  necessary for an accurate map and prolonged
                  navigation. The new local mapping scheme also
                  extends the endeavour towards reducing error
                  accumulation made in the global mapping strategy by
                  eliminating totally error accumulated between visits
                  to the same part of an environment. This is achieved
                  with a map matching strategy developed exclusively
                  for the advanced sonar sensor employed. The local
                  mapping strategy has been tested in large, real life
                  indoor environments and successful results are
                  reported here.},

  Abstract =	 {One of the critical components of mapping an unknown
                  environment is the robot? ability to locate itself
                  on a partially explored map. This becomes
                  challenging when the robot experiences positioning
                  error, does not have an external positioning device,
                  nor the luxury of engineered landmarks placed in its
                  free space. This paper presents a new method for
                  simultaneous localization and mapping that exploits
                  the topology of the robot? free space to localize
                  the robot on a partially constructed map. The
                  topology of the environment is encoded in a
                  topological map; the particular topological map used
                  in this paper is the generalized Voronoi graph
                  (GVG), which also encodes some metric information
                  about the robot? environment, as well. In this
                  paper, we present the low-level control laws that
                  generate the GVG edges and nodes, thereby allowing
                  for exploration of an unknown space. With these
                  prescribed control laws, the GVG (or other
                  topological map) can be viewed as an arbitrator for
                  a hybrid control system that determines when to
                  invoke a particular low-level controller from a set
                  of controllers all working toward the high-level
                  capability of mobile robot exploration. The main
                  contribution, however, is using the graph structure
                  of the GVG, via a graph matching process, to
                  localize the robot. Experimental results verify the
                  described work.},

                  or cognitive map, colled PLAN, is presented that
                  attempts to address a broader spectrum of issues
                  than has been previously attempted in a single
                  model. Rather than examining way-finding as a
                  process separate from the rest of cognition, one or
                  the fundamental goals of this work is to examine how
                  the wayfinding process is integrated into general
                  cognition. One result of this approach is that the
                  model is ?eads-up? or scene-based, because it takes
                  advantage of the properties of the human visual
                  system and, particularly, the visual system's split
                  into two pathways. The emphasis on the human
                  location or ?here?system is new to cognitive mapping
                  and is port of an attempt to synthesize prototype
                  theory, associative networks and location together
                  in a connectionist system. Not all of PLAN is new,
                  however. Many of its parts have analogues in one or
                  another preexisting theory. What makes PLAN unique
                  is integrating the various components into a
                  coherent whole, and the capacity of this resulting
                  system to speak to a wide range of constraints. Our
                  approach emphasizes adaptiveness; thus, our focus on
                  such issues as ease of use and efficiency of
                  learning. The result is a model that has a stronger
                  relationship both to the environment, and to the
                  ways that humans interact with it, compared with
                  previous models. The resulting model is examined in
                  some detail and compared to other systems.},

                  computational strategies used by the
                  brain. .. 1. The Visual World. What we see at any
                  given moment is in general a fully elaborated
                  representation of a visual scene. .. 2. Hierarchical
                  Processing. Signal elaboration proceeds from the
                  various retinal stages, to the LGN, and thence to
                  higher and higher cortical processing
                  stages. .. 3. Dependency Relations. Higher levels in
                  the processing hierarchy depend on lower levels, but
                  not, in general, vice versa. .. Note finally that
                  the caricature, and, most especially, the "visual
                  world" assumption of the caricature, gets compelling
                  endorsement from common sense. .. We conjecture that
                  the undeniable feeling of having whole scene visual
                  representation is the result mainly of (1) repeated
                  visual visits to stimuli in the scene, (2)
                  short-term semantic memory on the order of a few
                  seconds that maintains the general sense of what is
                  going on without creating and maintaining the
                  point-by-point detail, (3) the brain's
                  "objectification" of sensory perception such that a
                  signal processed in cortex is represented as being
                  about an object in space. .. In any event, it may be
                  worth trying to rethink and reinterpret many
                  physiological and anatomical results under the
                  auspices of the idea that perception is driven by
                  the need to learn action sequences to be performed
                  in space and time.},

                  sesnor-based navigation mode. For robot
                  localization, a slow process and a fast one are

                  mode, based on the same landmark selection and
                  tracking, is also presented; in order to navigate

                  propose a simple, geometrically intuitive method
                  which exploits the strong rigidity constraints of
                  parallelism and orthogonality present in indoor and
                  outdoor architectural scenes. We show how these
                  simple constraints can be used to calibrate the
                  cameras and to recover the projection matrices for
                  each viewpoint. The projection matrices are used to
                  recover partial 3D models of the scene and these can
                  be used to visualise new viewpoints. Our approach
                  does not need any a priori information about the
                  cameras being used. A working system called

                  this viewpoint we need to answer the important
                  question: What does the ability to move image
                  sensors give us in terms of solving vision tasks?},

                  Localization and Mapping (SLAM) relying on a
                  monocular camera as the only sensor, which is able
                  to build outdoor, closed-loop maps much larger than
                  previously achieved with such input. Our system,
                  based on the Hierarchical Map approach by Estrada et
                  al. (2005), builds independent local maps in
                  real-time using the EKF-SLAM technique and the
                  inverse depth representation proposed by Montiel et
                  al. (2006). The main novelty in the local mapping
                  process is the use of a data association technique
                  that greatly improves its robustness in dynamic and
                  complex environments. A new visual map matching
                  algorithm stitches these maps together and is able
                  to detect large loops automatically, taking into
                  account the unobservability of scale intrinsic to
                  pure monocular SLAM. The loop closing constraint is
                  applied at the upper level of the Hierarchical Map
                  in near real-time. We present experimental results
                  demonstrating monocular SLAM as a human carries a
                  camera over long walked trajectories in outdoor
                  areas with people and other clutter, even in the
                  more difficult case of forward-looking camera, and
                  show the closing of loops of several hundred
                  meters.},

                  service which supplies such information is not a
                  satisfactory solution. Activities of users at
                  terminals and most application programs should
                  remain unaffected when the internal representation
                  of data is changed and even when some aspects of the
                  external representation are changed. Changes in data
                  representation will often be needed as a result of
                  changes in query, update, and report traffic and
                  natural growth in the types of stored

                  normal form for data base relations, and the concept
                  of a universal data sublanguage are introduced. In
                  Section 2, certain operations on relations (other
                  than logical inference) are discussed and applied to
                  the problems of redundancy and consistency in the

                  robots. The team consists of a navigator that has to
                  reach an initially unknown target location and a set
                  of cartographers that randomly move through the
                  environment to nd the target location. When a robot
                  discovers the goal point, the location is
                  communicated among the cartographers to the
                  navigation robot which then starts to move to that
                  location. In extensive experiments, the author
                  analyzes the performance of this approach and
                  compares it to the optimal solution for different

                  evolves slowly over time, while technical systems
                  are built to achieve an acceptable level of
                  confidence quite fast. Evidence for this could be
                  seen from a long term experiment described in
                  \citet{Golledge97book}. This study addressed the
                  metric knowledge of people, who had newly arrived in
                  an unknown city, and therefore were totally
                  unfamiliar with the new environment. In order to
                  monitor the gain of spatial knowledge the spatial
                  layout of the cognitive map has been reconstructed
                  using a multidimensional scaling (MDS)

                  observed over nine months, showed a steadily

                  further been shown that subjects tend to stick to
                  preferred routes, and that these routes are

                  localization, but can determine that a new
                  observation comes from a previously unseen place,
                  and so augment its map. Effectively this is a SLAM
                  system in the space of appearance. Our probabilistic
                  approach allows us to explicitly account for
                  perceptual aliasing in the environment--identical
                  but indistinctive observations receive a low
                  probability of having come from the same place. We
                  achieve this by learning a generative model of place
                  appearance. By partitioning the learning problem
                  into two parts, new place models can be learned
                  online from only a single observation of a
                  place. The algorithm complexity is linear in the

                  suitable for online loop closure detection in mobile

                  the current fundamental challenges of
                  robotics. Although a great deal of success has been
                  achieved with laser range finders as sensors and a

                  describe the application of "FastSLAM" [1] to the

                  maintaining multiple maps corresponding to those
                  possible position hypothesis, the algorithm has the

  abstract =	 {We introduce an any-space algorithm for exact
                  inference in Bayesian networks, called recursive
                  conditioning. On one extreme, recursive conditioning
                  takes O(n) space and O(nexp(wlogn)) time - where n
                  is the size of a Bayesian network and w is the width
                  of a given elimination order - therefore,
                  establishing a new complexity result for
                  linear-space inference in Bayesian networks. On the
                  other extreme, recursive conditioning takes
                  O(nexp(w)) space and O(nexp(w)) time, therefore,
                  matching the complexity of state-of-the-art
                  algorithms based on clustering and elimination. In
                  between linear and exponential space, recursive
                  conditioning can utilize memory at increments of
                  X-bytes, where X is the number of bytes needed to
                  store a floating point number in a cache. Moreover,
                  the algorithm is equipped with a formula for
                  computing its average running time under any amount
                  of space, hence, providing a valuable tool for
                  time-space tradeoffs in demanding
                  applications. Recursive conditioning is therefore
                  the first algorithm for exact inference in Bayesian
                  networks to offer a smooth tradeoff between time and
                  space, and to explicate a smooth, quantitative
                  relationship between these two important resources.},

  abstract =	 {This paper demonstrates an approach which exploits
                  an active camera as a projective pointing
                  mechanism. The optical centre of a static camera is
                  notionally substituted by the centre of rotation of
                  the active camera, as is the image plane by a
                  frontal plane, a plane perpendicular to the optical
                  axis of the active camera in its resting
                  direction. Algorithms devised for 3D motion and 3D
                  structure recovery using a single passive camera
                  become immediately applicable to the active camera
                  without need for reformulation. Furthermore, because
                  the active camera can access a panoramic field of
                  view, instabilities which may arise when the field
                  of view is small, or because the shared field of
                  view between successive views after movement is
                  small, are lessened. Two quite different
                  applications of the idea are presented. In the
                  first, the homography between a planar surface in
                  the scene and the frontal plane is recovered and
                  used to recover scene trajectories. In the second,
                  the essential matrix between points in two
                  frontal-plane "views" is recovered and used to
                  determine the motion of a mobile vehicle.},

                  method] is a satisfactory method of frame by frame
                  visually guided navigation. Clearly the serial
                  search for points would be too time consuming. The
                  method has more immediate promise as a method of
                  re-orientation, perhaps after the vehicle becomes
                  interrupted during some purposive navigation task by
                  a more urgent reactive task.},

                  move, then re-fixate and compute the motion of the
                  platform. As they admit, this is not advocated as a

                  move in two dimensions on a ground plane. While this
                  is often a good approximation, a large number of
                  real-world applications require robots to move
                  around terrain which has significant slopes and
                  undulations, and it is desirable that these robots
                  too should be able to estimate their locations by
                  building maps of natural features. In this paper we

                  moving through general, unknown scenes becomes a
                  much more challenging problem when real-time
                  performance is required rather than under the
                  off-line processing conditions under which most
                  successful structure from motion work has been
                  achieved. This task of estimating camera motion from
                  measurements of a continuously expanding set of
                  selfmapped visual features is one of a class of
                  problems known as Simultaneous Localisation and
                  Mapping (SLAM) in the robotics community, and we
                  argue that such real-time mapping research, despite
                  rarely being camera-based, is more relevant here
                  than off-line structure from motion methods due to
                  the more fundamental emphasis placed on propagation
                  of uncertainty. We present a top-down Bayesian
                  framework for singlecamera localisation via mapping
                  of a sparse set of natural features using motion
                  modelling and an informationguided active
                  measurement strategy, in particular addressing the
                  difficult issue of real-time feature initialisation
                  via a factored sampling approach. Real-time handling
                  of uncertainty permits robust localisation via the
                  creating and active measurement of a sparse map of
                  landmarks such that regions can be re-visited after
                  periods of neglect and localisation can continue
                  through periods when few features are
                  visible. Results are presented of real-time
                  localisation for a hand-waved camera with very
                  sparse prior scene knowledge and all processing

  r-Elinas06icra ={Work on monocular SLAM that does not depend on
                  robot odometry has been presented in [this]. Their
                  approach is mostly tailored to real-time
                  performance. In consequence, they identify visual
                  landmarks using salient visual features that are not
                  necessarily distinctive enough for operation in
                  large environments. This approach is also based on
                  the Extended Kalman Filter that is inefficient
                  because the filter scales quadratically in the
                  number of landmarks.},

                  literature. He resolves the problem of real-time
                  operation by careful maintenance of the map to
                  ensure that it is sparse but sufficient, and by
                  using the map uncertainty to guide feature

                  measurements which will be obtained. While such
                  priors are commonly combined with the actual
                  measurements via Bayes?rule to calculate posterior
                  probability distributions on model parameters, their
                  additional value in guiding efficient image
                  processing has almost always been overlooked. Priors

                  how much computational effort we can expect to
                  expend to extract it, and of how much utility to the
                  task in hand it is likely to be. Such considerations
                  are of importance in all practical real-time vision

                  problematic because appearance can vary widely
                  depending on illumination, viewing distance, angle
                  of view and so on. Storing a separate image or
                  `template' for every possible view requires vast
                  numbers to be stored and scanned, has a high
                  probability of recognition error and appears not to
                  be the solution adopted by primates. However, some
                  invertebrate template matching systems can achieve
                  recognition by `active vision' in which the animal's
                  own behaviour is used to achieve a fit between
                  template and object, for example by repeatedly

                  views from the set path but achieved with a minimal

                  offers adjustable trade-off between accuracy and

                  (OR) search space view, the AND/OR search tree
                  displays some of the independencies present in the

                  can all be accommodated within the bucket

                  updating, finding the most probable explanation, and

                  algorithm, but is in fact an elegant computation on
                  a factor graph. By computing a rooted clique tree on
                  this graph, the computation can be parallelized
                  across subtrees, which forms the basis of so-called
                  multifrontal QR methods. By judiciously choosing the
                  order in which variables are eliminated in the
                  clique tree computation, we show that one
                  straightforwardly obtains a method for performing
                  inference in distributed sensor networks. One
                  obvious application is distributed localization and
                  mapping with a team of robots. We phrase the problem
                  as inference on a large-scale Gaussian Markov Random
                  Field induced by the measurement factor graph, and
                  show how multifrontal QR on this graph solves for
                  the global map and all the robot poses in a
                  distributed fashion. The method is illustrated using
                  both small and large-scale simulations, and
                  validated in practice through actual robot
                  experiments.},

                  images. First, dense depth maps are estimated by
                  aligning a planar region of a scene in each image,
                  approximating camera calibration, and generating
                  dense planar parallax. These depth maps are then
                  robustly fused to obtain incrementally refined
                  surface estimates. It is envisaged that this system
                  will extend the modelling capability of existing

                  networks [Jensen, et.al., 1990, Lauritzen and
                  Spiegelhalter, 1988] requires clustering the nodes
                  in the network into a junction tree. In the
                  traditional view, the junction tree is constructed
                  from the cliques of the moralized and triangulated
                  belief network: triangulation is taken to be the
                  primitive concept, the goal towards which any
                  clustering algorithm (e.g. node elimination) is
                  directed. In this paper, we present an alternative
                  conception of clustering, in which clusters and the
                  junction tree property play the role of primitives:
                  given a graph (not a tree) of clusters which obey (a
                  modified version of) the junction tree property, we
                  transform this graph until we have obtained a
                  tree. There are several advantages to this approach:
                  it is much clearer and easier to understand, which
                  is important for humans who are constructing belief
                  networks; it admits a wider range of heuristics
                  which may enable more efficient or superior
                  clustering algorithms; and it serves as the natural
                  basis for an incremental clustering scheme, which we
                  describe.}

                  uses of fuzzy sets: representing preference profiles
                  and modelling uncertainty distributions. The first
                  setting leads to a valued, noncompensatory
                  generalization of constraint-directed
                  scheduling. The other setting yields a
                  possibility-theoretic counterpart of PERT, where
                  probability distributions of activity durations are
                  changed into possibility distributions, for the
                  purpose of modelling incomplete information. It is
                  pointed out that a special case of the latter,
                  interval-valued PERT, is a difficult, ill-known
                  problem, regarding the determination of critical
                  activities, latest starting times and floats. Lastly
                  when flexible constraints and uncertain processing
                  times are to be jointly considered, the use of
                  possibilistic decision theory leads to the
                  computation of robust schedules. }

                  metric is assumed of the world. The robot is assumed
                  to be able to autonomously traverse graph edges,
                  recognize when it has reached a vertex, and
                  enumerate edges incident upon the current vertex
                  relative to the edge via which it entered the
                  current vertex. The robot cannot measure distances,
                  and it does not have a compass. It is demonstrated
                  that this exploration problem is unsolvable in
                  general without markers, and, to solve it, the robot
                  is equipped with one or more distinct markers that
                  can be put down or picked up at will and that can be
                  recognized by the robot if they are at the same
                  vertex as the robot. An exploration algorithm is
                  developed and proven correct. Its performance is

  Year =	 1990,
  Abstract =	 {A fully decentralized architecture is presented for
                  data fusion problems. This architecture takes the
                  form of a network of sensor nodes, each with its own
                  processing facility, which together do not require
                  any central processor or any central communication
                  facility. In this architecture, computation is
                  performed locally and communication occurs between
                  any two nodes. Such an architecture has many
                  desirable properties, including robustness to
                  sensors failure and flexibility to the addition or
                  loss of one or more sensors. This architecture is
                  appropriate for the class of extended Kalman filter
                  (EKF)-based geometric data fusion problems. The
                  starting point for this architecture is an algorithm
                  which allows the complete decentralization of the
                  multisensor EKF equations among a number of sensing
                  nodes. This algorithm is described, and it is shown
                  how it can be applied to a number of different
                  data-fusion problems. An application of this
                  algorithm to the problem of multicamera, real-time

                  becomes more difficult as the complexity of the
                  environment increases. With conventional techniques,
                  the cost of maintaining estimates rises rapidly with
                  the number of landmarks mapped. We present a
                  monocular SLAM system that employs a particle filter
                  and top-down search to allow realtime performance
                  while mapping large numbers of landmarks. To our
                  knowledge, we are the first to apply this
                  FastSLAM-type particle filter to single-camera
                  SLAM. We also introduce a novel partial
                  initialization procedure that efficiently determines
                  the depth of new landmarks. Moreover, we use
                  information available in observations of new
                  landmarks to improve camera pose estimates. Results

                  self-position. The results, with those of Rieser
                  (1989), indicate that in the case of regularly

                  travel, it may be capable of seeing the street scene

                  kilometer of the Oort cloud on January 1, 0800 hours
                  UTC, 2008 CE, which it happened to have viewed while
                  on a heliopause cruise. .. Note that although the
                  evolution of visual systems may well be driven by
                  their role in supporting action and by their being
                  embodied in active, purposive agents (Noe, 2004),
                  once the system is in place no action is required
                  for it to "just see" (Edelman, 2006). .. [A key
                  realization is that] rather than conceptual,
                  purposive, and interpretation-driven, visual
                  experience, whether rich or impoverished, is
                  representational. As Wittgenstein (1958) noted, "To
                  interpret is to think, to do something; seeing is a
                  state." .. Both the feasibility of and the need for
                  an explicit and sweeping reconstruction of the
                  geometry of the visual world have been subsequently
                  questioned (Aloimonos et al., 1988; Bajcsy,
                  1988). Noting that biological vision is purposive
                  and active, researchers proposed that computer
                  vision too should aim at serving certain
                  well-defined goals such as navigation or recognition
                  rather than at constructing a general-purpose
                  representation of the world. .. From the
                  computational standpoint, this development amounted
                  to shifting the focus of research from "inverse
                  optics" approaches (Bertero et al., 1988), which aim
                  to recover the solid geometry of the viewed scene,
                  to managing feature-based evidence for task-specific
                  hypotheses about the input (Edelman and Poggio,
                  1989). .. Anticipating the idea of O'Regan (1992)
                  and O'Regan and Noe (2001) who argued that the world
                  is its own best representation, Reitman et
                  al. (1978, p.72) observed that "The primary function
                  of perception is to keep our internal framework in

                  about the world and view objects from different
                  distances and directions, the images projected onto
                  the retina are correspondingly transformed?y
                  translation, magnification, rotation and so on. How,
                  despite rarely experiencing the same image twice, do
                  we recognize an object as being the same? This
                  problem has had a long and varied history involving
                  disparate disciplines: philosophy and psychology;
                  computer science, mathematics, and engineering;
                  anatomy and physiology; and, to a limited extent,
                  neurology. There is still no universally accepted
                  solution. In broad terms, explanatory theories can
                  be divided into two kinds: those that concentrate on
                  the nature of the internal model or representation
                  that the visual system forms of an object in the
                  external world, and those that concentrate on how
                  that representation alters with changes in the pose
                  of the object or changes in observer viewpoint. The
                  two approaches involve a trade-off. Thus, if the
                  representation is assumed to alter with a change in
                  viewpoint, then the visual system needs to apply an
                  internal restoring, interpolating, or normalizing
                  transformation for recognition to occur; and the
                  more work that is done in forming the representation
                  (the more invariant it is to viewpoint changes), the
                  less work that needs to be done in normalizing
                  it. In practice, factors such as the need to retain
                  information about viewpoint changes and whether
                  objects are to be compared simultaneously or
                  sequentially influence the extent of the
                  trade-off. \\ One of the first significant
                  theoretical analyses of visual (and auditory)
                  representation and recognition was undertaken in the
                  1940s by Walter Pitts and Warren McCulloch, who
                  showed how a biological system could calculate
                  constant properties?nvariants?f entire images under
                  changes in viewpoint. It was not at all clear,
                  however, whether these global invariants could, or
                  should, be computed; moreover, the required
                  biological machinery seemed demanding, and the
                  representations assumed to be produced took little
                  account of the structure of the images presented to
                  the organism. \\ In the decades that followed, a
                  more object-centred approach to the problem of
                  extracting invariants developed. The idea was to
                  associate with each image a `structural
                  description', specifying the configuration of an
                  object's components or local features (e.g. lines
                  and edges) in terms of discrete or qualitative
                  relations between those features (e.g. `joined to',
                  `above', `left of'). Such a description was
                  naturally invariant to translations and
                  magnifications of the image on the retina, and,
                  depending on the choice of relations, to its
                  rotations. \\ A particular structural-description
                  theory of recognition, called
                  `recognition-by-components', has been advocated by
                  Irving Biederman. Here, the object components are
                  generalized cones, derived from contrasts of five
                  edge cues in a two-dimensional image: curvature,
                  collinearity, symmetry, parallelism and
                  co-termination. Visual detection of these elementary
                  properties is assumed to be invariant over viewing
                  position. Experiments on picture priming, where
                  speed and accuracy of recognition of a briefly
                  presented picture is facilitated by prior
                  presentation, suggested that priming depends on
                  activation of these components. Changes in position,
                  size, orientation-in-depth, or the particular lines
                  and vertices present in the image did not affect the
                  magnitude of the priming, as long as the same
                  generalized-cone components were assumed to be
                  activated. \\ Descriptions of the structure of
                  images based on object parts are appealing because
                  objects are often only part-seen, for example, from
                  the front only, or occluded by other objects. Such
                  descriptions naturally represent non-rigid or
                  articulated objects, for example, a body or hand;
                  and, phenomenologically, they accommodate our
                  experience that objects, such as a cup or a face,
                  are actually perceived as comprising
                  parts. Nevertheless, there has been some debate in
                  the literature about how well object parts can be
                  extracted from images and how well such descriptions
                  account for data on the recognition of novel and
                  familiar objects that have been rotated in depth. \\
                  An alternative to describing the structure of images
                  in terms of combinations of generic primitive shapes
                  is to describe them in terms of memory records of
                  similar images. One starting point for this theory
                  is that it is unreasonable for a visual system to
                  treat all possible shapes within the same parametric
                  framework: whereas similar shapes may need to be
                  compared in detail, very different shapes need
                  merely to be distinguished from each other. How,
                  then, should similar images be described? For a
                  given class of similar shapes, it is known from
                  statistical pattern-recognition theory that a
                  representation can be obtained in a common space
                  spanned by a small set of reference shapes,
                  generally referred to as basis functions. One way of
                  generating basis functions is to apply the
                  statistical technique of principal-components
                  analysis, which has been used successfully to
                  explain how the visual system approximates a
                  solution to the theoretically simpler problem of
                  surface colour constancy, that is, the constant
                  colour appearance of an object's surface independent
                  of the illuminant on the scene. Another way of
                  generating basis functions from a set of data is to
                  expose an artificial neural network to prototypical
                  examples drawn from that set. \\ In Representation
                  and Recognition in Vision, Shimon Edelman sets out
                  the case for such a network-based scheme called
                  Chorus. In this scheme, vectors of proximities to a
                  small number of prototypes are used to span the
                  representation space. The prototypes are derived
                  from recurring stable patterns of primitive
                  features, which, by definition, correspond to
                  frequently observed objects. Each prototype is
                  represented by an interpolation mechanism similar to
                  a basis-function neural network tuned to several of
                  the object's views, and is learned from examples. \\
                  The elementary building block of Chorus? unit tuned
                  to a specific view of a specific object?s inherently
                  viewpoint-dependent, but, because the tuning of the
                  individual units is wide (that is, they also
                  respond, usually less well, to views that differ
                  from the optimal), it is possible for a collection
                  of such units to interpolate the entire space of
                  views for a given object. Viewpoint invariance
                  achieved in this way will be approximate and
                  specific for the given object and the degree of
                  viewpoint invariance will decrease when the objects
                  to be discriminated are similar to each other. A
                  system of several object-specific modules of this
                  kind should exhibit some viewpoint invariance for
                  novel objects, by interpolating between the view
                  spaces of the familiar ones. \\ Support for Chorus
                  has come from experiments with synthesized images of
                  abstract, paperclip-like objects and more natural
                  animal-like objects. In one experiment, human
                  subjects were trained to discriminate between
                  computer images selected from classes of monkey-like
                  and dog-like objects. After subjects reached 90\%
                  correct on a fixed canonical view of each object,
                  discrimination performance was tested for novel
                  views that differed by up to 60?from the training
                  view. Despite differing only parametrically, that
                  is, in degree rather than in kind, these objects
                  were recognized virtually independently of
                  viewpoint, providing that the two classes were
                  sufficiently dissimilar. These and the results of
                  other experimental tests were taken as evidence for
                  a theory of recognition by views and against a
                  theory of recognition by components. \\ Which of
                  these two theories is the more appropriate
                  description of human object recognition is unlikely
                  to be resolved by appeals to neurobiology. For
                  example, recordings in macaque temporal cortex have
                  shown specificity for face view and gaze direction,
                  and the extent of any invariance to viewing
                  conditions is limited to about ?0?rotation in
                  depth. These results are certainly consistent with
                  Chorus, but, as Edelman points out, it is possible
                  that the function of the underlying units could be
                  irrelevant to the process of object recognition. \\
                  Views-based theories suffer from certain
                  foundational problems, as Edelman readily
                  acknowledges. Thus, a principled way needs to be
                  found for defining the set of objects constituting
                  the training set and for dealing with occlusion and
                  interference between the images of neighbouring
                  objects in a scene. There are also some outstanding
                  experimental issues; for example, how to account for
                  psychophysical data showing that shape recognition
                  and discrimination vary systematically with the
                  position of the image on the retina. More
                  critically, there is persistent evidence that small
                  changes in object shape can influence visual
                  perception in a way that seems more naturally
                  explained by components-based theory than by
                  views-based theory. \\ In Representation and
                  Recognition in Vision, Edelman argues strongly for a
                  particular approach to modelling human object
                  recognition, focusing arguments and evidence to that
                  end. It is a stimulating and informative book, but
                  better suited to the sophisticated reader, and
                  rather less so to the beginner hoping to achieve a
                  broad understanding of a sometimes contentious
                  field.},

                  a model of the scene background. We present a novel
                  non-parametric background model and a background
                  subtraction approach. The model can handle
                  situations where the back- ground of the scene is
                  cluttered and not completely static but contains
                  small motions such as tree branches and bushes. The

                  absence of accurate landmark position measurements
                  and motion estimates. Our work differs from other
                  approaches because landmark estimates are derived
                  from stereo vision and motion estimates are based on
                  sparse optical flow. We distinguish between
                  landmarks using the Scale Invariant Feature

                  visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping Problem
                  (SLAM). We focus on robots equipped with stereo
                  vision and develop a SLAM solution based on the
                  theory of the Rao-Blackwellised particle filter
                  (RBPF). We refer to our method as $\sigma$SLAM. We
                  construct maps of 3D point-landmarks identified by
                  their visual appearance. Specifically, we use the
                  Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) for
                  distinguishing among the thousands of landmarks
                  present in the robot? environment. Our particle
                  filter approach utilizes a mixture proposal
                  distribution and accurately tracks the position of
                  the robot and the landmarks over long
                  trajectories. In addition, we do not depend on robot
                  odometry in the particle filter? proposal mechanism;
                  instead, we develop a proposal distribution that
                  relies on visual odometry easing the transition
                  towards a SLAM solution for robots performing 3D
                  motion. Most importantly, $\sigma$SLAM works in near
                  real-time making it applicable for use with mobile
                  robots today. Moreover, we show that we can
                  construct 2D occupancy-grid maps from stereo vision;
                  these are useful for path planning and obstacle
                  avoidance. Finally, we validate our approach
                  experimentally mapping large indoor environments

                  method that allows us to obtain accurate metric maps
                  of large environments in real time. The lower (or
                  local) map level is composed of a set of local maps
                  that are guaranteed to be statistically
                  independent. The upper (or global) level is an
                  adjacency graph whose arcs are labeled with the
                  relative location between local maps. An estimation
                  of these relative locations is maintained at this
                  level in a relative stochastic map. We propose a
                  close to optimal loop closing method that, while

                  consistency at the global level at a computational
                  cost that is linear with the size of the

                  the covariance of the other local maps when adding
                  an observation for a particular local map is that,
                  The reference of the local map is the location of
                  first robot pose with complete confidence(zero
                  covariance). This idea is same as
                  Williams02icra. But what makes this paper is
                  different is using the loop closing for improving
                  the relative location of local maps with respect to
                  each other in the global map. They don't use this
                  data to update the local maps, because if so they
                  would have become dependent to each other. The good
                  thing about using the local maps is that since the
                  updates are carried on local data, it reduces the
                  harmful effect of linearization. }

                  the Sparse Extended Information Filter (SEIF) by

                  simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM)
                  information matrix is exactly sparse in a
                  delayed-state framework. Such a framework is used in
                  view-based representations of the environment that
                  rely upon scan-matching raw sensor data to obtain
                  virtual observations of robot motion with respect to
                  a place it has previously been. The exact sparseness
                  of the delayed-state information matrix is in
                  contrast to other recent feature-based SLAM
                  information algorithms, such as sparse extended
                  information filter or thin junction-tree filter,
                  since these methods have to make approximations in
                  order to force the feature-based SLAM information
                  matrix to be sparse. The benefit of the exact
                  sparsity of the delayed-state framework is that it
                  allows one to take advantage of the information
                  space parameterization without incurring any sparse
                  approximation error. Therefore, it can produce
                  equivalent results to the full-covariance
                  solution. The approach is validated experimentally
                  using monocular imagery for two datasets: a
                  test-tank experiment with ground truth, and a
                  remotely operated vehicle survey of the RMS

                  for this concurrent mapping and localization (CML)
                  problem have been implemented for single vehicles,
                  but do not account for extra positional information
                  available when multiple vehicles operate
                  simultaneously. Multiple vehicles have the potential
                  to map an environment more quickly and robustly than
                  a single vehicle. This paper presents a cooperative
                  CML algorithm that merges sensor and navigation
                  information from multiple autonomous vehicles. The
                  algorithm presented is based on stochastic

                  algorithm is presented, and a convergence theorem
                  central to the cooperative CML problem is proved for

  Review =	 {More than one third of the human brain is devoted to
                  the processes of seeing - vision is after all the
                  main way in which we gather information about the
                  world. But human vision is a dynamic process during
                  which the eyes continually sample the
                  environment. Where most books on vision consider it
                  as a passive activity, this book is unique in
                  focusing on vision as an 'active' process. It goes
                  beyond most accounts of vision where the focus is on
                  seeing, to provide an integrated account of seeing
                  AND looking. The book starts by pointing out the
                  weaknesses in our traditional approaches to vision
                  and the reason we need this new approach. It then
                  gives a thorough description of basic details of the
                  visual and oculomotor systems necessary to
                  understand active vision. The book goes on to show
                  how this approach can give a new perspective on
                  visual attention, and how the approach has
                  progressed in the areas of visual orienting,
                  reading, visual search, scene perception and
                  neuropsychology. Finally, the book summarises
                  progress by showing how this approach sheds new
                  light on the old problem of how we maintain
                  perception of a stable visual world. Written by two
                  leading vision scientists, this book will be
                  valuable for vision researchers and psychology
                  students, from undergraduate level upwards.},

                  used in everyday life, and how they have led to a
                  new perspective in visual science, in which more
                  emphasis is placed on the active role of the
                  viewer. The article discusses two bodies of research
                  presented at the conference of the Association for
                  Research in Vision and Ophthalmology (Ft Lauderdale,
                  Florida; May 1998). M. Land, et al and R. Steinman,
                  et al highlighted the detailed patterns of visual
                  behavior involving the constant reflection of the
                  fovea of a freely moving human S to new locations in
                  the visual field, with the gaze direction changing
                  several times each second. The findings of these
                  bodies of research are discussed.},
  quotes =	 {The direction of the eyes showed how the activity
                  sequence was directed by vision: the
                  ?o-it-where-you-look?strategy. .. Thus, as
                  emphasized by various authors [3,4], gaze activity
                  is generally under tight cognitive control from
                  high-level plans. Only very occasionally did the
                  eyes appear possibly to stray to a distracting
                  visually salient object. .. Human observers are
                  loath to make use of internalised visual memory,
                  rather using the alternative option of accessing
                  visual information in the external environment
                  whenever it is needed. .. This transfer of the same
                  behaviour from the eyes to the head suggests that
                  active vision processes can be transferred from one
                  motor system to another.},

                  robustness to data association errors. Another
                  important advantage of our algorithm is that
                  non-linearities are computed exactly, so that global
                  constraints can be imposed even if they result in
                  large shifts to the map. We represent the map as a
                  graph and use the graph to find an efficient map
                  update algorithm. We also show how topological
                  consistency can be imposed on the map, such as,
                  closing a loop. The algorithm has been implemented
                  on an outdoor robot and we have experimental
                  validation of our ideas. We also explain how the
                  graph can be simplified leading to linear
                  approximations of sections of the map. This
                  reduction gives us a natural way to connect local

                  features that addresses symmetries and constraints

                  representation allows for the features to be added
                  to the map with partial initialization. This is an
                  important property when using oriented vision
                  features where angle information can be used before
                  their full pose is known. The number of the
                  dimensions for a feature can grow with time as more
                  information is acquired. At the same time as the
                  special properties of each type of feature are
                  accounted for, the commonalities of all map features

                  also allows large maps to be built up as a network

                  fundamental problem in mobile robotics. In this
                  paper we present an approach to distributed
                  multi-robot mapping and exploration. Our system
                  enables teams of robots to efciently explore
                  environments from different, unknown locations. In
                  order to ensure consistency when combining their
                  data into shared maps, the robots actively seek to
                  verify their relative locations. Using shared maps,
                  they coordinate their exploration strategies so as
                  to maximize the efciency of exploration. Our system
                  was evaluated under extremely realistic real-world
                  conditions. An outside evaluation team found the
                  system to be highly efcient and robust. The maps
                  generated by our approach are consistently more
                  accurate than those generated by manually measuring

  Abstract =	 { In the past decade, a large number of robots has
                  been built that explicitly implement biological
                  navigation behaviours. We review these biomimetic
                  approaches using a framework that allows for a
                  common description of biological and technical
                  navigation behaviour. The review shows that
                  biomimetic systems make significant contributions to
                  two fields of research: First, they provide a real
                  world test of models of biological navigation
                  behaviour; second, they make new navigation
                  mechanisms available for technical applications,
                  most notably in the field of indoor robot
                  navigation. While simpler insect navigation
                  behaviours have been implemented quite successfully,
                  the more complicated way-finding capabilities of
                  vertebrates still pose a challenge to current
                  systems.},

                  maintaining a course or trajectory to a goal
                  location.?.. The forms of spatial behaviour captured
                  by the above definition fall into two fundamentally
                  different groups: local navigation and
                  way-finding. .. [navigation hierarchy:] Local
                  navigation behaviours are divided into four levels:
                  search, direction-following, aiming and guidance;
                  way-finding behaviours into three levels:
                  recognition-triggered response, topological and
                  survey navigation. .. In computer science, a similar
                  hierarchy has been presented by Kuipers. .. Examples
                  of local navigation mechanisms, recognition-
                  triggered responses and topological navigation can
                  be found throughout the animal kingdom, whereas
                  survey navigation may be limited to
                  vertebrates. .. 4.1. Recognition-triggered response:
                  Insects can associate movement decisions with visual
                  landmarks. Ants, for instance, may learn to always
                  pass a landmark on the right side. .. Bees are able
                  to learn routes, i.e., connected chains of
                  recognition-triggered responses. .. biological
                  systems seem to construct topological
                  representations by integrating routes in a bottom-up
                  manner [38]. This ability has been observed in many
                  animals, ranging from honeybees [16] to humans
                  [21]. ..The above described robot systems show that,
                  mostly within the last five years, biomimetic
                  approaches have been developed for most types of
                  biological navigation, with the exception of search
                  and survey navigation. However, the field is still
                  at the beginning of its development. This is
                  documented by the fact that all of the reviewed
                  approaches aim at testing biological models or
                  mechanisms rather than at finding an optimal
                  technical solution to a given problem. .. From the
                  bionic point of view, biomimetic research has
                  yielded a number of interesting new navigation
                  mechanisms. In particular, corridor-following based
                  on optic flow, path integration with a polarization
                  compass, snapshot-based guidance and
                  recognition-triggered responses are now well
                  understood. .. Before a biomimetic survey navigation
                  system can be built, the hurdle of topological
                  navigation has to be taken. Although the principle
                  problems are well understood, there is currently no
                  system that autonomously builds graphs from routes
                  in a larger scale environment. In our opinion,
                  reliable topological navigation could be the
                  challenge of the near future. Once this is achieved,
                  a number of interesting questions concerning survey
                  navigation can be addressed; for instance, how the
                  topological representation should be embedded in a
                  common reference frame, or how much metric
                  information is necessary for this behaviour. A
                  biomimetic robot capable of survey navigation would
                  finally close the loop that began with abandoning
                  the traditional map-based navigation systems.},

                  by local views of the surrounding scene, and finds
                  traversable paths between them. The set of recorded
                  views and their connections are combined into a
                  graph model of the environment. To navigate between
                  views connected in the graph, we employ a homing
                  strategy inspired by findings of insect ethology. In
                  robot experiments, we demonstrate that complex
                  visual exploration and navigation tasks can thus be

                  finding moving objects in a video sequence---for
                  example, cars driving on a freeway. The idea is that
                  subtracting the current image from a time-averaged
                  background image will leave only nonstationary
                  objects. It is, however, a crude approximation to
                  the task of classifying each pixel of the current
                  image; it fails with slow-moving objects and does
                  not distinguish shadows from moving objects. The
                  basic idea of this paper is that we can classify
                  each pixel using a model of how that pixel looks
                  when it is part of different classes. We learn a
                  mixture-of-Gaussians classification model for each
                  pixel using an unsupervised technique---an
                  efficient, incremental version of EM. Unlike the
                  standard image-averaging approach, this
                  automatically updates the mixture component for each
                  class according to likelihood of membership; hence
                  slow-moving objects are handled perfectly. Our
                  approach also identifies and eliminates shadows much
                  more effectively than other techniques such as
                  thresholding. Application of this method as part of
                  the Roadwatch traffic surveillance project is
                  expected to result in significant improvements in
                  vehicle identification and tracking.},

                  for high level interpretation and localization in
                  complex scenes. In urban environments, recognition
                  of buildings might play a dominant role in robotic
                  systems that need object based navigation, that take
                  advantage of visual feedback and multimodal
                  information for self-localization, or that enable
                  association to related information from the
                  identified semantics. We present a new method "the
                  informative local features approach" based on an
                  information theoretic saliency measure that is
                  rapidly derived from a local Parzen window density
                  estimation in feature subspace. From the learning of
                  a decision tree based mapping to informative
                  features, it enables attentive access to
                  discriminative information and thereby significantly
                  speeds up the recognition process. This approach is
                  highly robust with respect to severe degrees of
                  partial occlusion, noise, and tolerant to some
                  changes in scale and illumination. We present

                  the efficiency of this approach, case wise even

  abstract =	 {According to present genetic theory, the fine
                  structure of genes consists of linearly ordered
                  elements. A mutant gene is obtained by alteration of
                  some connected portion of this structure. By
                  examining data obtained from suitable experiments,
                  it can be determined whether or not the blemished
                  portions of two mutant genes intersect or not, and
                  thus intersection data for a large number of mutants
                  can be represented as an undirected graph. If this
                  graph is an "interval graph", then the observed data
                  are consistent with a linear model of the
                  gene. Given a family of sets $S_1,S_2,\cdots,S_n$,
                  one can form the intersection graph of the family by
                  associating a vertex of the graph with each set and
                  joining two distinct vertices with an edge if their
                  corresponding sets have a nonempty
                  intersection. Conversely, any finite graph can, of
                  course, be viewed as the intersection graph of a
                  family of sets (in many ways). If each set can be
                  taken as an interval on the real line, the graph is
                  called an interval graph. The problem of determining
                  when a graph is an interval graph is a special case
                  of the following problem concerning
                  $(0,1)$-matrices: When can the rows of such a matrix
                  be permuted so as to make the 1's in each column
                  appear consecutively? A complete theory is obtained
                  for this latter problem, culminating in a
                  decomposition theorem which leads to a rapid
                  algorithm for deciding the question, and for
                  constructing the desired permutation when one
                  exists.},

                  view of the ground plane are presented. This
                  representation significantly simplifies the solution
                  to navigation problems, by eliminating any
                  perspective effects. The nature of each navigation
                  taskis taken into account when designing the
                  required navigation skills and environmental
                  representations. We propose two main navigation
                  modalities: Topological Navigation and Visual Path
                  Following. Topological Navigation is used for
                  traveling long distances and does not require
                  knowledge of the exact position of the robot but
                  rather, a qualitative position on the topological
                  map. The navigation process combines appearance
                  based methods and visual servoing upon some
                  environmental features. Visual Path Following is
                  required for local, very precise navigation, for
                  e.g. door traversal, docking. The robot is
                  controlled to follow a pre-specified path
                  accurately, by tracking visual landmarks in bird?
                  eye views of the ground plane. By clearly separating
                  the nature of these navigation tasks, a simple and
                  yet powerful navigation system is obtained.},

                  study, and many important enhancements have been
                  made to it. This paper describes these various
                  enhancements, their historical development, and some
                  experiments showing how very effective they are in
                  improving the execution time of the algorithm. A
                  shortcoming is also presented that exists in all of
                  the widely used implementations of the algorithm,
                  namely, that the quality of the ordering provided by
                  the implementations is surprisingly sensitive to the
                  initial ordering. For example, changing the input
                  ordering can lead to an increase (or decrease) of as
                  much as a factor of three in the cost of the
                  subsequent numerical factorization. This sensitivity
                  is caused by the lack of an effective tie-breaking
                  strategy, and the authors' experiments illustrate
                  the importance of developing such a strategy.},

                  might be expected that their loss would be
                  catastrophic. An opportunity arose recently
                  \cite{Gilchrist97nature} to examine this proposition
                  in an individual who was born without functional eye
                  muscles. The eyes of this unusual individual are
                  fixed in her head. Surprisingly she is hardly
                  impaired; she reads well and leads a normal life as
                  a university student. At first glance, this might
                  appear to support the traditional approach to
                  studying vision; after all she gets on perfectly
                  well without eye movements. It turns out, however,
                  that in visual tasks she makes head scanning
                  movements with comparable properties to the eye
                  movements of an unimpaired subject. This transfer of
                  the same behaviour from the eyes to the head
                  suggests that active vision processes can be
                  transferred from one motor system to another. Active
                  vision is crucially dependent upon orienting
                  movements, but these do not need to be eye
                  movements.},

                  navigation, e.g. of a semi-automatic
                  wheelchair. Such applications pose some additional
                  requirements, like the need to work with natural
                  landmarks rather than artificial markers, and the
                  need to recognize locations fast. The restricted

                  the feature extraction. These features should

                  nevertheless restricted viewing directions, and

                  because they are a rich source of environment
                  information. The main challenge in using images for
                  mobile robots is managing this wealth of
                  information. A relatively recent approach is the use
                  of fast wide baseline local features, which we
                  developed and used in the novel approach to sparse
                  visual path following described in this paper. These
                  local features have the great advantage that they
                  can be recognized even if the viewpoint differs
                  significantly. This opens the door to a memory
                  efficient description of a path by descriptors of
                  sparse images. We propose a method for re-execution
                  of these paths by a series of visual homing
                  operations which yield a navigation method with
                  unique properties: it is accurate, robust, fast, and

                  partition has interesting implications in query
                  processing, dependency theory, and graph theory. The
                  tree/cyclic partitioning of database schemas
                  originated with a similar partition of equijoin
                  queries. Given an arbitrary equijoin query one can
                  obtain an equivalent query that calculates the

                  of tractable CSPs based on the concept of hypertree

                  and analyze the cost of solving CSPs having bounded

                  comparing parametric decomposition-based methods
                  according to tractability criteria and compare the
                  most relevant methods. We show that the method of
                  hypertree decomposition dominates the others in the
                  case of general CSPs (i.e., CSPs of unbounded
                  arity). We also make comparisons for the restricted

                  graph of a hypergraph. In fact, this technique is
                  often used to exploit binary decomposition methods

                  decentralized sensor networks in which there is no
                  central fusion center and in which no single sensor
                  node has global knowledge of network topology. An
                  algorlthm is described which is able to locally
                  process and assimilate data in such networks and
                  which yields an identical result to that obtained in
                  a centralized system. An implementation of this
                  decentralized data fusion algorithm on a process
                  control rig incorporating over 150 sensors and 30
                  processors is described. The results show that the
                  decentralized data fusion system described in this
                  paper offers many advantages in terms of robustness,
                  scalability and flexibility over a centralized
                  system.},

                  estimator guarantees that tree-connected networks of

                  connected networks or centralized data fusion
                  systems. For more general sensor networks with
                  multiple paths between nodes, it is shown that
                  within the constraints imposed, there is no finite
                  set of estimators that will, in general, allow the
                  local computation of an estimate equivalent to the
                  centralized estimate. [...] The information filter
                  is directly an implementation of Bayes theorem in
                  terms of log-likelihood rather than in terms of
                  state. For this reason, it is occasionally referred
                  to as the likelihood filter. [The log likelihoods]
                  may simply be summed to yield the posterior
                  log-likelihood [which] provides a far more natural
                  method of aggregating data than does the
                  conventional Kalman filter. [Similar data fusion
                  methods] may be applied to cases when the underlying
                  probabilities are not Gaussian, and indeed in cases
                  where the underlying state-space is discrete. These
                  cases lead directly to an information theory

                  problem. This approach uses a particle lter in which
                  each particle carries an individual map of the
                  environment. Accordingly, a key question is how to
                  reduce the number of particles. In this paper we
                  present adaptive techniques to reduce the number of
                  particles in a Rao-Blackwellized particle lter for
                  learning grid maps. We propose an approach to
                  compute an accurate proposal distribution taking
                  into account not only the movement of the robot but
                  also the most recent observation. This drastically
                  decrease the uncertainty about the robot's pose in

                  re-sampling operations which seriously reduces the
                  problem of particle depletion. Experimental results
                  carried out with mobile robots in large-scale indoor
                  as well as in outdoor environments illustrate the

                  descent to minimize the error introduced by
                  constraints. Together with multi-level relaxation,
                  this is one of the most robust and efficient maximum
                  likelihood techniques published so far. In this
                  paper, we present an extension of Olson?
                  algorithm. It applies a novel parameterization of
                  the nodes in the graph that significantly improves
                  the performance and enables us to cope with
                  arbitrary network topologies. The latter allows us
                  to bound the complexity of the algorithm to the size
                  of the mapped area and not to the length of the
                  trajectory as it is the case with both previous
                  approaches. We implemented our technique and
                  compared it to multi-level relaxation and Olson?
                  algorithm. As we demonstrate in simulated and in
                  real world experiments, our approach converges
                  faster than the other approaches and yields accurate
                  maps of the environment.},

                  have been introduced as an effective means to solve
                  the simultaneous localization and mapping
                  problem. This approach uses a particle filter in
                  which each particle carries an individual map of the
                  environment. Accordingly, a key question is how to
                  reduce the number of particles. In this paper, we
                  present adaptive techniques for reducing this number
                  in a RBPF for learning grid maps. We propose an
                  approach to compute an accurate proposal
                  distribution, taking into account not only the
                  movement of the robot, but also the most recent
                  observation. This drastically decreases the
                  uncertainty about the robot's pose in the prediction
                  step of the filter. Furthermore, we present an
                  approach to selectively carry out resampling
                  operations, which seriously reduces the problem of
                  particle depletion. Experimental results carried out
                  with real mobile robots in large-scale indoor, as
                  well as outdoor, environments illustrate the
                  advantages of our methods over previous approaches},

                  Simultaneous Localization and Map Building (SLAM)
                  algorithm. It presents optimal algorithms that
                  consider the special form of the matrices and a new
                  compressed filter that can significantly reduce the
                  computation requirements when working in local areas
                  or with high frequency external sensors. It is shown
                  that by extending the standard Kalman filter models
                  the information gained in a local area can be
                  maintained with a cost O(Na^2), where Na is the
                  number of landmarks in the local area, and then
                  transferred to the overall map in only one iteration
                  at full SLAM computational cost. Additional
                  simplifications are also presented that are very
                  close to optimal when an appropriate map
                  representation is used. Finally the algorithms are
                  validated with experimental results obtained with a
                  standard vehicle running in a completely
                  unstructured outdoor environment.},

                  acquiring environment maps is that of closing loops;
                  loops in the environment create challenging data
                  association problems [9]. This paper presents a
                  novel algorithm that combines Rao-Blackwellized
                  particle filtering and scan matching. In our
                  approach scan matching is used for minimizing
                  odometric errors during mapping. A probabilistic
                  model of the residual errors of scan matching
                  process is then used for the resampling steps. This
                  way the number of samples required is seriously
                  reduced. Simultaneously we reduce the particle
                  depletion problem that typically prevents the robot
                  from closing large loops. We present extensive
                  experiments that illustrate the superior performance
                  of our approach compared to previous approaches.},

  abstract =	 {The problem of generating maps with mobile robots
                  has received considerable attention over the past
                  years. Most of the techniques developed so far have
                  been designed for situations in which the
                  environment is static during the mapping
                  process. Dynamic objects, however, can lead to
                  serious errors in the resulting maps such as
                  spurious objects or misalignments due to
                  localization errors. In this paper we consider the
                  problem of creating maps with mobile robots in
                  dynamic environments. We present a new approach that
                  interleaves mapping and localization with a
                  probabilistic technique to identify spurious
                  measurements. In several experiments we demonstrate
                  that our algorithm generates accurate 2d and 3d in
                  different kinds of dynamic indoor and outdoor
                  environments. We also use our algorithm to isolate
                  the dynamic objects and to generate
                  three-dimensional representation of them.}

  Year =	 2003,
  Abstract =	 {In the current study, we explored observers' use of
                  two distinct analyses for determining their
                  direction of motion, or heading: a scene-based
                  analysis and a motion-based analysis. In two
                  experiments, subjects viewed sequentially presented,
                  paired digitized images of real-world scenes and
                  judged the direction of heading; the pairs were
                  presented with various interstimulus intervals
                  (ISIs). In Experiment 1, subjects could determine
                  heading when the two frames were separated with a
                  1,000-ms ISI, long enough to eliminate apparent
                  motion. In Experiment 2, subjects performed two
                  tasks, a path-of-motion task and a memory-load task,
                  under three different ISIs, 50 ms, 500 ms, and 1,000
                  ms. Heading accuracy decreased with an increase in
                  ISI. Increasing memory load influenced heading
                  judgments only for the longer ISI when motion-based
                  information was not available. These results are
                  consistent with the hypothesis that the scene-based
                  analysis has a coarse spatial representation, is a
                  sustained },
  quotes =	 {The question we addressed in the present study is
                  whether observers can use static information to
                  determine heading. .. This demonstration, [...]
                  illustrates people? ability to perceive a change in
                  the observer? position independent of a perception
                  of motion. .. We propose that the motion-based
                  analysis is a transient system that updates
                  information very rapidly. .. In contrast, the
                  scene-based analysis is a sustained system in which
                  information is encoded and stored over long periods
                  of time. .. We propose that the scene-based analysis
                  is a high-level process that has encoding capacity
                  limitations. Informal reports from observers in our
                  pilot study suggested that they consciously scanned
                  the second frame to determine the change in observer
                  position. .. [Requiring] observers to perform a
                  secondary task does not influence heading judgments,
                  suggesting that recovering heading from flow fields
                  does not involve attention.},

  abstract =	 {Density-based modeling of visual features is very
                  common in computer vision, either by using
                  non-parametric techniques or through representing
                  the underlying density function as a weighted sum of
                  Gaussians. A number of real-time tasks such as
                  background modeling or modeling the appearance of a
                  moving target require sequential density estimation,
                  where new data is incorporated in the model as it
                  becomes available. Nevertheless, current methods for
                  updating the density function either lack
                  flexibility, by fixing the number of Gaussians in
                  the mixture, or require large memory amounts, by
                  maintaining a non-parametric representation of the
                  den- sity. This paper presents an efficient method
                  for recursive density approximation that relies on
                  the propagation of the density modes. At each time
                  step, the modes of the density are re-estimated and
                  a Gaussian component is assigned to each mode. The
                  covariance of each component is derived from the
                  Hessian matrix estimated at the mode location. To
                  detect the modes we employ the variable-bandwidth
                  mean shift. While the proposed density
                  representation is memory efficient (which is typical
                  for mixture densities), it inherits the flexibility
                  of non-parametric methods, by allowing the number of
                  modes to adapt in time. We show that the same mode
                  propagation principle applies for subspaces derived
                  from eigen analysis. Extensive experimental
                  background modeling results demonstrate the
                  performance of the method. },

  abstract =	 {This paper presents the case for a functional
                  account of vision. A variety of studies have
                  consistently revealed ?hange blindness?or
                  insensitivity to changes in the visual scene during
                  an eye movement. These studies indicate that only a
                  small part of the information in the scene is
                  represented in the brain from moment to moment. It
                  is still unclear, however, exactly what is included
                  in visual representations. This paper reviews
                  experiments using an extended visuo-motor task,
                  showing that display changes affect performance
                  differently depending on the observer? place in the
                  task. These effects are revealed by increases in
                  fixation duration following a change. Different
                  task-dependent increases suggest that the visual
                  system represents only the information that is
                  necessary for the immediate visual task. This allows
                  a principled exploration of the stimulus properties
                  that are included in the internal visual
                  representation. The task specificity also has a more
                  general implication that vision should be
                  conceptualized as an active process executing
                  special purpose ?outines?that compute only the
                  currently necessary information. Evidence for this
                  view and its implications for visual representations
                  are discussed. Comparison of the change blindness
                  phenomenon and fixation durations shows that
                  conscious report does not reveal the extent of the
                  representations computed by the routines.},
  quotes =	 {The role of vision from moment to moment is
                  determined almost exclusively by the current stage
                  in accomplishing the task. There appears to be
                  little room for other functions. Performance is also
                  highly serialized. .. Another compelling feature of
                  the behaviour was the similarity between
                  subjects. .. The crucial advantage of task-specific
                  routines is computational efficiency. .. In the case
                  of human vision the retinal image is changing every
                  several hundred milliseconds as the observer changes
                  gaze. Thus, the relevant information must be
                  extracted very quickly. .. Direction of gaze can be
                  used to specify the location of the needed
                  information in the visual scene and the time when it
                  is needed. This makes complex internal
                  representations unnecessary because the
                  observer/autonomous system can acquire the necessary
                  information from the scene during performance of the
                  task, rather than using the information inherent in
                  an internal model. .. The computational advantage of
                  task specific representations comes at a cost. A
                  crucial problem for any system like this is: How are
                  more complex behaviours composed using the
                  individual routines? That is, how is the scheduling
                  of the individual routines handled? .. What, then,
                  can we conclude about the content of visual
                  representations from the change blindness work and
                  the results described here? [] The general consensus
                  [] is that the visual information retained after a
                  change in fixation position is very limited.},

  abstract =	 {The classic experiments of Yarbus over 50 years ago
                  revealed that saccadic eye movements reflect
                  cognitive processes. But it is only recently that
                  three separate advances have greatly expanded our
                  understanding of the intricate role of eye movements
                  in cognitive function. The first is the
                  demonstration of the pervasive role of the task in
                  guiding where and when to fixate. The second has
                  been the recognition of the role of internal reward
                  in guiding eye and body movements, revealed
                  especially in neurophysiological studies. The third
                  important advance has been the theoretical
                  developments in the fields of reinforcement learning
                  and graphic simulation. All of these advances are
                  proving crucial for understanding how behavioral
                  programs control the selection of visual
                  information.},
  quotes =	 {Together, these developments have allowed the
                  simulation of rewardbased systems that incorporate
                  realistic models of eye movements over extended time
                  scales. This has shifted the focus of experimental
                  understanding from where in a scene the eyes fixate
                  in an image, to why the eyes choose a location in a
                  scene, and when they choose it. .. The most novel
                  finding of task-oriented studies is that the eyes
                  are positioned at a point that is not the most
                  visually salient, but is the best for the
                  spatio-temporal demands of the job that needs to be
                  done. This line of investigation has been used in
                  extended visuo-motor tasks such as driving, walking,
                  sports, and making tea or sandwiches[]. .. Not only
                  is the sequence of fixations tightly linked to the
                  task, but in addition, fixations appear to have the
                  purpose of obtaining quite specific
                  information. .. In driving, Shinoda et al. [42]
                  showed that approximately 45\% of fixations fell
                  close to intersections. As a consequence of this,
                  subjects were more likely to notice ?top?signs
                  located at intersections as opposed to signs in the
                  middle of a block, suggesting in turn that subjects
                  have learnt that traffic signs are more likely
                  around intersections. .. The value of VR is that it
                  allows the creation of human models that implement
                  complex visuo-motor loops for the control of
                  temporally extended behaviors. .. One of the
                  principal findings of these simulations is that the
                  informationfromfixations supports behavior
                  indifferent ways. In this respect is very helpful to
                  think of the visual computations that need to be
                  done as hierarchically organized, a viewpoint that
                  has not been as obvious from the
                  attention/working-memory dichotomy. Table 1 shows
                  the basic elements of a representative hierarchy
                  that has three levels ?Behavior, Arbitration and
                  Context ?highlighting the different roles of vision
                  at each level. .. The mental programs that drive
                  gaze selection are increasingly seen to be
                  reward-based.},

  abstract =	 {Camera motion estimation is useful for a range of
                  applications. Usually, feature tracking is performed
                  through the sequence of images to determine
                  correspondences. Furthermore, robust statistical
                  techniques are normally used to handle large number
                  of outliers in correspondences. This paper proposes
                  a new method that avoids both. Motion is calculated
                  between two consecutive stereo images without any
                  pre-knowledge or prediction about feature location
                  or the possibly large camera movement. This permits
                  a lower frame rate and almost arbitrary
                  movements. Euclidean constraints are used to
                  incrementally select inliers from a set of initial
                  correspondences, instead of using robust statistics
                  that has to handle all inliers and outliers
                  together. These constraints are so strong that the
                  set of initial correspondences can contain several
                  times more outliers than inliers. Experiments on a
                  worst-case stereo sequence show that the method is
                  robust, accurate and can be used in real-time.},

                  develop a system capable of carrying out
                  'locate-and-protect' missions: the system must be
                  able to deploy a large number of robots into an
                  unexplored building, map the building interior,
                  locate a valued object, detect and track intruders,
                  and transmit all of the above information to a
                  remote observer/operator. To satisfy these
                  requirements, we have developed a large
                  heterogeneous robot team consisting of approximately
                  80 robots. This paper sketches the key technical
                  elements of this system, and presents selected

                  independently of each other until one coincidentally

                  a surface embedded in a higher-dimensional
                  space. The key advantage of the manifold
                  representation is selfconsistency: when closing
                  loops, manifold maps do not suffer from the "cross
                  over" problem exhibited in planar maps. This
                  self-consistency, in turn, facilitates a number of
                  important capabilities, including autonomous
                  exploration, search, and retro-traverse. It also
                  supports a very robust form of loop closure, in
                  which pairs of robots act collectively to confirm or
                  reject possible correspondence points. In this
                  paper, we develop the basic formalism of the
                  manifold representation, show how this may be
                  applied to the multirobot simultaneous localization
                  and mapping problem, and present experimental
                  results obtained from teams of up to four robots in
                  environments ranging in size from 400 to 900 m2.},

  abstract =	 {To interact effectively with humans, mobile robots
                  will need certain skills. One particularly important
                  skill is the ability to pursue moving agents. To do
                  this, the robot needs a robust visual tracking
                  algorithm and an effective obstacle avoidance
                  algorithm, plus a means of integrating these two
                  behaviors in a seamless manner. In this paper, we
                  introduce the proximity space method as a means for
                  performing real-time, behavior-based control of
                  visual gaze. We then show how this method is
                  integrated with robot motion using an intelligent
                  control architecture that can automatically
                  reconfigure the robot's behaviors in response to
                  environmental changes. The resulting implementation

                  a person). Correllation-based tracking was triggered
                  after a period of active searching for movement, and
                  extra vision modules helped the tracking to be
                  stable. The system was not truly an active vision

  abstract =	 {Most recent robotic systems, capable of exploring
                  unknown environments, use topological structures
                  (graphs) as a spatial representation. Localization
                  can be done by deriving an estimate of the global
                  pose from landmark information. In this case
                  navigation is tightly coupled to metric knowledge,
                  and hence the derived control method is mainly
                  pose-based. Alternative to continuous metric
                  localization, it is also possible to base
                  localization methods on weaker constraints, e.g. the
                  similarity between images capturing the appearance
                  of places or landmarks. In this case navigation can
                  be controlled by a homing algorithm. Similarity
                  based localization can be scaled to continuous
                  metric localization by adding additional
                  constraints, such as alignment of depth
                  estimates. We present a method to scale a similarity
                  based navigation system (the view-graph-model) to
                  continuous metric localization. Instead of changing
                  the landmark model, we embed the graph into the
                  three dimensional pose space. Therefore,
                  recalibration of the path integrator is only
                  possible at discrete locations in the
                  environment. The navigation behavior of the robot is
                  controlled by a homing algorithm which combines
                  three local navigation capabilities, obstacle
                  avoidance, path integration, and scene based
                  homing. This homing scheme allows automated
                  adaptation to the environment. It is further used to
                  compensate for path integration errors, and
                  therefore allows to derive globally consistent pose
                  estimates based on ?eak?metric knowledge,
                  i.e. knowledge solely derived from odometry. The
                  system performance is tested with a robotic setup
                  and with a simulated agent which explores a large,
                  open, and cluttered environment.},

                  is a critical need for their use in military or

                  involves the combination of absolute location
                  information (e.g. GPS) with relative calibration
                  information (e.g. time delay or received signal
                  strength between sensors) over regions of the
                  network. Furthermore, it is generally desirable to
                  distribute the computational burden across the
                  network and minimize the amount of inter-sensor
                  communication. We demonstrate that the information

  Abstract =	 {This article discusses about the developing
                  paradigms of data for sensor-actuator networks that
                  perform engineering tasks. We provide a new
                  foundation for data fusion based on two concepts: a
                  conceptual framework and the goal-seeking
                  paradigm. The conceptual framework emphasizes the
                  dominant structures in the system. The goal-seeking
                  paradigm is a mechanism for representing system
                  evolution that explicitly manages uncertainty. The
                  goal-seeking formulation for data fusion helps to
                  distinguish between subjective decisions that can be
                  executed by computers. These notions are useful for
                  critical tasks, such as security management in
                  large-scale distributed systems. Investigations in
                  this area, and further refinement of the
                  goal-seeking formulation for instrumentation and
                  measurement applications, are likely to future
                  systems that facilitate holistic user decision
                  making.},

  abstract =	 {We present a background subtraction method that uses
                  multiple cues to robustly detect objects in adverse
                  conditions. The algorithm consists of three distinct
                  levels i.e pixel level, region level and frame
                  level. At the pixel level, statistical models of
                  gradients and color are separately used to classify
                  each pixel as belonging to background or
                  foreground. In region level, foreground pixels
                  obtained from the color based subtraction are
                  grouped into regions and gradient based sub-
                  traction is then used to make inferences about the
                  validity of these regions. Pixel based models are
                  updated based on decisions made at the region
                  level. Finally frame level analysis is performed to
                  detect global illumination changes. Our method
                  provides the solution to some of the common prob-
                  lems that are not addressed by most background
                  subtraction algorithms such as quick illumination
                  changes, repositioning of static background objects,

  Abstract =	 {This paper deals with the problem of recovering the
                  dimensions of an object and its pose from a single
                  image acquired with a camera of unknown focal
                  length. It is assumed that the object in question
                  can be modeled as a polyhedron where the coordinates
                  of the vertices can be expressed as a linear
                  function of a dimension vector. The reconstruction
                  program takes as input, a set of correspondences
                  between features in the model and features in the
                  image. From this information, the program determines
                  an appropriate projection model for the camera, the
                  dimensions of the object, its pose relative to the
                  camera and, in the case of perspective projection,
                  the focal length of the camera. This paper describes
                  how the reconstruction problem can be framed as an
                  optimization over a compact set with low dimension
                  (no more than four). This optimization problem can
                  be solved efficiently by coupling standard nonlinear
                  optimization techniques with a multistart
                  method. The result is an efficient, reliable
                  solution system that does not require initial
                  estimates for any of the parameters being estimated},

                  fg masks, and bg which are pixelwisely
                  modeled. Multiple layers/bg modeling were not
                  addressed in Jojic00cvpr. The model is layered model
                  in that it assumes that the image is generated by
                  overlapping the bg image with the fg'son top of one
                  another with appropriate translations. The possible
                  tranlations (motions) are predefined as discrete
                  variables as in their Jojic00cvpr work. The authors
                  then solve the learning problem which involves the
                  learning of fgs/bg model+masks and motions in each
                  image through variational-EM in the maximum
                  likelihood frameowrkbecause the problem got coupled
                  severely between variables and exact EM is not
                  feasible anymore. Unlike their HMM work in
                  Jojic00cvpr, they do not have put frame ordering
                  constraints in their model and allow all the
                  translations to be equally likely. This would
                  suggest that a clever way of using such dynamic
                  constraints which is partly studied in Jojic00cvpr
                  by using HMMs as a way to have motion model can
                  improve the learning results. It is my impression
                  that this is very hard to solve the problems with
                  dynamic constraints in case of multiple layers. That
                  would be the reason why Jojic and Frey are using a
                  static model that does not consider the video
                  ordering for this work. They successfully learn the
                  fgs/bg model from the unordered images, and show fg
                  subtraction, removal of a second fg selectively from
                  the video, person appearance enhancements. One main
                  advantage of their works would be the use of mask
                  which seems to be rather unintuitive, but can
                  capture the non-rigid appearance of arbitrary
                  objects},

                  feature tracks that is determined in the E-step,
                  based on the current estimate of the motion. This

                  is suitable for real-time reconstruction from such
                  multi-camera configurations. We have implemented the
                  system and show experimental results in a
                  large-scale environment, using a custom made
                  eight-camera rig.},

                  addresses the data association problem and allows
                  real-time application in large-scale
                  environments. We employ smoothing to obtain the
                  complete trajectory and map without the need for any
                  approximations, exploiting the natural sparsity of
                  the smoothing information matrix. A QR-factorization
                  of this information matrix is at the heart of our
                  approach. It provides efficient access to the exact
                  covariances as well as to conservative estimates
                  that are used for online data association. It also
                  allows recovery of the exact trajectory and map at
                  any given time by back-substitution. Instead of
                  refactoring in each step, we update the

                  how our approach extends to the non-linear
                  case. Finally, we provide experimental validation of
                  the overall non-linear algorithm based on the

                  real-time applications in large-scale

                  without the need for any approximations, and that we
                  do not suffer from linearization errors. We achieve
                  efficiency by updating the square-root information
                  matrix, a factored version of the naturally sparse

                  estimation problem in the form of marginal

                  access these quantities without calculating the full
                  and dense covariance matrix, which is prohibitively
                  expensive.  We present a dynamic programming
                  algorithm for efficient recovery of the marginal
                  covariances needed for data association. As input we

  abstract =	 {The paper provides a unifying perspective of
                  tree-decomposition algorithms appearing in various
                  automated reasoning areas such as join-tree
                  clustering for constraint-satisfaction and the
                  clique-tree algorithm for probabilistic
                  reasoning. Within this framework, we introduce a new
                  algorithm, called bucket-tree elimination (BTE),
                  that extends Bucket Elimination (BE) to trees, and
                  show that it can provide a speed-up of n over BE for
                  various reasoning tasks. Time-space tradeoffs of
                  tree-decomposition processing are analyzed.},
  quotes =	 {The idea of embedding a database that consists of a
                  collection of functions or relations in a tree
                  structure and, subsequently, processing it
                  effectively by a tree-processing algorithm, has been
                  discovered and rediscovered in different
                  contexts. ... The aim of this paper is to present
                  the central concepts and properties of cluster-tree
                  decomposition techniques by way of a single, unified
                  framework for the purpose of making it more
                  accessible to researchers in diverse areas and
                  facilitating the transfer of this methodology among
                  these areas. Specifically, we demonstrate that
                  join-tree clustering, junction-tree decomposition,
                  and hyper-tree decomposition that, as mentioned
                  above, were developed in different contexts and for
                  different applications, are all instances of our
                  unified scheme. Also, as we show, variable
                  elimination algorithms can be viewed as processing
                  specific cluster-tree decompositions. ... Our work
                  expands on \cite{Shafer90uai} in several
                  ways. First, we use a graph-based language,
                  connecting our approach explicitly to graphical
                  models and using graph-based parameters for
                  capturing algorithmic principles. In particular, we
                  provide graph-based complexity analysis that focuses
                  on the time vs. space issue. Second, we emphasize
                  the distinction between the generation of a
                  structural tree-decomposition and the
                  tree-processing algorithms that are enabled by the
                  decomposition. Third, we show that variable
                  elimination algorithms can be viewed as a specific
                  tree-processing schemes that can be generalized to
                  full processing along special tree-decompositions
                  called bucket trees. Finally, we note how different
                  tree-decompositions of a given problem yield a
                  spectrum of time-space complexity characteristics
                  using superbuckets. ... Join-trees correspond to
                  minimal tree-decompositions. This restriction
                  exclude the super-bucket methods that accommodates
                  time-space trade-offs. ... We present these classes
                  of algorithms by harnessing the formal notation
                  appearing in \cite{Gottlob00ai} (which is restricted
                  there to constraint satisfaction). This allows
                  separating tree-structuring from tree-processing.},

  Abstract =	 {Development of multiple robot systems which solve
                  complex and dynamic problems in parallel and
                  distributed manners is one of the key issues in
                  robotics research. The multiple robot systems
                  require robust methods to identify robots for
                  collaborative behaviors. This paper proposes a
                  method using omnidirectional vision sensors for the
                  identification between the robots. In addition to
                  the several advantages of the omnidirectional vision
                  sensor as a vision of a mobile robot, the
                  omnidirectional vision sensor brings a significant
                  benefit for realizing collaborative behaviors in
                  multiple robot systems. After discussing on the
                  algorithm, this paper shows several simulation
                  results and real experimental results in a real
                  environment},

                  structured so that the target variable (hypotheses)
                  are logically distant from the observable events
                  (data). In this situation it may be difficult or
                  impossible to assess the probabilistic connection
                  between them, but it may be possible to decompose
                  the problem through the use of intermediate or
                  explanatory variables. That is, it will often be
                  possible to assess the likelihood of the observed
                  data given some intermediate variable, and the
                  likelihood of that intermediate variable given
                  another, and so on, until the hypotheses of interest
                  are reached. Inferences which incorporate one or
                  more intermediate variables are called hierarchical,
                  cascaded, or multistage inferences. The present
                  paper presents a normative model for the solution of
                  the general hierarchical inference problem. The
                  formulation begins with a formal description of the
                  hierarchical inference tree, including a discussion
                  of various simplifying conditional independence
                  assumptions. The solution is first derived for three
                  special case models of differing structure, and then
                  the algorithm for the general solution is given for
                  two cases: one in which the conditional independence
                  assumptions have been made and one in which they

  Volume =	 11,
  Year =	 1999,
  abstract =	 {The basis of visually guided locomotion is the
                  ambient optical flow. Because animals with frontal
                  eyes can sample only a portion of the flow field,
                  they must continuously scan in order to be aware of
                  their surroundings. Such scanning introduces
                  additional transformations of the retinal image,
                  apparently complicating the extraction from retinal
                  flow of the information in optical flow. In this
                  study, the authors conducted computer simulations of
                  eye movement graphically. These simulations revealed
                  that when gaze direction coincides with heading
                  direction on curvilinear paths, velocity vectors in
                  the image plane become linearized. The active
                  rotation of the eyes is, in effect, an essential
                  mechanism for extracting the self-movement
                  information contained in optical flow from flow
                  patterns on the retinas. Strategically positioning
                  the eyes renders a nonlinear flow linear and,
                  thereby, converts a complicated information pickup
                  problem into a considerably simpler problem. Based
                  on these simulations, the authors contend that
                  heading direction is specified by the
                  perpendicularly aligned vectors.},
  quotes =	 {A possible resolution is suggested, however, by a
                  simulation of the retinal flow when the eyes are
                  directed at a point lying on the locomotory
                  path. For this field of view, all the image
                  trajectories are linearized. The vector directions
                  in Figure 3e are the same over successive
                  frames. Each velocity vector [] lies in the
                  direction tangent to the corresponding flow line
                  (i.e., the trajectory that a surface element
                  traces). Curves formed by connecting the velocity
                  vectors with the same direction define streamlines
                  of a flow field (Sutton, 1957). .. In contrast to
                  the complexities suggested by the preceding remarks,
                  there seems to be a simple rule for identifying the
                  path of locomotion regardless of its nature, that
                  is, linear or circular: Move the eyes until the
                  image trajectories on the retina are rendered
                  linear; then you are looking in the direction in
                  which you are heading, and the trajectory defined by
                  the perpendicular image vectors is your path of
                  locomotion. .. To conclude, why do we rotate the
                  eyes if, as often argued, rotation serves only to
                  induce ambiguity? Based on the arguments presented
                  here, the active rotation of the eyes is, in effect,
                  an essential mechanism for extracting the
                  self-movement information contained in optical flow
                  from flow patterns on the retinas. Strategically
                  positioning the eyes renders a nonlinear flow linear
                  and, thereby, converts a complicated information
                  pickup problem into a considerably simpler problem.},
  r-Wilkie03jov ={It has been proposed that the rotation introduced
                  into retinal flow by eye-movements can actually
                  simplify the steering task (Kim & Turvey, 1999; Wann
                  & Swapp, 2000).},

                  previously unknown environment is desirable for a
                  wide range of applications. In computer vision this
                  problem is studied as monocular SLAM. Recent years
                  have seen improvements to the usability and
                  scalability of monocular SLAMsystems to the point
                  that they may soon find uses outside of laboratory
                  conditions. However, the robustness of these systems
                  to rapid camera motions (we refer to this quality as
                  agility) still lags behind that of tracking systems
                  which use known object models. In this paper we
                  attempt to remedy this. We present two approaches to
                  improving the agility of a keyframe-based SLAM
                  system: Firstly, we add edge features to the map and
                  exploit their resilience to motion blur to improve
                  tracking under fast motion. Secondly, we implement a
                  very simple inter-frame rotation estimator to aid
                  tracking when the camera is rapidly panning � and
                  demonstrate that this method also enables a
                  trivially simple yet effective relocalisation
                  method. Results show that a SLAM system combining
                  points, edge features and motion initialisation
                  allows highly agile tracking at a moderate increase
                  in processing time.  }

                  solution is exact and gives the same result as
                  updating the whole map in every frame. Their
                  algorithm is still O(m^2) but it provides the

  abstract =	 {This study addresses the question of how simple
                  networks can account for a variety of phenomena
                  associated with the shift of a specialized
                  processing focus across the visual scene. We address
                  in particular aspects of the dichotomy between the
                  preattentive-parallel and the attentive-serial modes
                  of visual perception and their hypothetical neuronal
                  implementations. Specifically, we propose the
                  following: (1) A number of elementary features, such
                  as color, orientation, direction of movement,
                  disparity etc. are represented in parallel in
                  different topographical maps, called the early
                  representation. (2) There exists a selective mapping
                  from this early representation into a more central
                  representation, such that at any instant the central
                  representation contains the properties of only a
                  single location in the visual scene, the {\it
                  selected} location. (3) We discuss some selection
                  rules that determine which location will be mapped
                  into the central representation. The major rule,
                  using the saliency or conspicuity of locations in
                  the early representation, is implemented using a
                  so-called Winner-Take-All network. A hierarchical
                  pyramid--like architecture is proposed for this
                  network. We suggest possible implementations in
                  neuronal hardware, including a possible role for the
                  extensive back-projection form the cortex to the
                  LGN.},

                  tial to many areas of IVHS (Intelligent Vehicle
                  High- way Systems). Traffic scene information can be
                  used to optimize traffic flow during busy periods,
                  identify stalled vehicles and accidents, and aid the
                  decision- making of an autonomous vehicle
                  controller. Improve- ments in technologies for
                  machine vision-based surveil- lance and high-level
                  symbolic reasoning have enabled us to develop a
                  system for detailed, reliable traffic scene
                  analysis. The machine vision component of our system
                  employs a contour tracker and an affine motion model
                  based on Kalman filters to extract vehicle
                  trajectories over a sequence of traffic scene
                  images. The symbolic reasoning component uses a
                  dynamic belief network to make inferences about
                  traffic events such as vehicle lane changes and

                  misconception that the line between poly- trees and
                  other networks was a sharp cutoff, so that only
                  inference in polytrees was tractable. ... Thus, if
                  we find a chordal graph that contains the moralized
                  graph , we can use it as the basis for inference on
                  . The process of turning a graph into a chordal
                  graph is also called
                  triangulation. ... Historically, largely due to the
                  initial popularity of the polytree algorithm, the
                  conditioning approach has been mostly used in the
                  case where the transformed network is a
                  polytree. ... one might wonder why anyone bothers
                  with the con- ditioning algorithm. There are two
                  main reasons. First, variable elimination gains its
                  computational savings from caching factors computed
                  as intermediate results. The second reason for using
                  conditioning is that it forms the basis for a useful
                  approximate inference algorithm.},

                  the cost of factorizing a matrix derived from the
                  measurements into a square root form, which has
                  cubic complexity in the worst case. However, the
                  matrices associated with the full SLAM problem are
                  typically very sparse, as opposed to the dense
                  problems one obtains in a filtering context. Hence
                  much faster, sparse factorization algorithms can be
                  used. Furthermore, the cost can be further reduced
                  by choosing a good order in which to eliminate
                  variables during the factorization process, leading
                  to more or less fill-in. In particular, in this
                  paper we investigate how a nested dissection
                  ordering method can provably improve the performance
                  of the full SLAM algorithm. We show that the
                  computational complexity for the factorization of a
                  large class of measurement matrices occurring in the
                  SLAM problem can be tightly bound under reasonable
                  assumptions.},
  c-kaess =	 {This paper analyzes the complexity of planar SLAM
                  based on nested dissection. A quick comparison for
                  planar SLAM examples shows only a marginal advantage
                  of AMD ordering over nested dissection, but the
                  latter is easier to analyze. Based on existing
                  theorems, it is shown that planar SLAM with nested
                  dissection has fill-in O(n log n) and time
                  complexity O(n^1.5), but with potentially large
                  constant factors. While SLAM graphs even in planar
                  environments are not exactly planar, they can be
                  "compressed" (graph theory) into a meta graph that
                  is exactly planar. An urban map serves as
                  example. Special cases with linear complexity are
                  environments of bounded size (first eliminate all
                  poses - Schur complement trick), exploration without
                  loop closure, and fixed sensor networks (first
                  eliminate all structure).},

                  combined to tactical navigation in routes; landmarks
                  in space are contrasted to routemarks in networks of
                  passages. Survey knowledge comes in at the level of
                  strategic navigation. The Bremen Autonomous
                  Wheelchair is then presented as a vehicle for
                  experimentation in robotics, both to model
                  biologically plausible navigational behaviors and to
                  develop efficient navigational mechanisms for a
                  technical application. The implementation on the
                  autonomous system is based on the use of basic
                  behaviors and the identification of routemarks. The
                  actual recognition of artificial routemarks is
                  described and early results of the current work on
                  the identification of natural 3-D marks are

                  `local' functions, each of which depends on a subset

                  visualized with a bipartite graph that we call a

                  multiple interacting representations, both
                  qualitative and quantitative. The SSH is inspired by
                  the properties of the human cognitive map, and is
                  intended to serve both as a model of the human
                  cognitive map and as a method for robot exploration
                  and map-building. The multiple levels of the SSH
                  express states of partial knowledge, and thus enable
                  the human or robotic agent to deal robustly with
                  uncertainty during both learning and
                  problem-solving. The control level represents useful
                  patterns of sensorimotor interaction with the world
                  in the form of trajectory-following and
                  hill-climbing control laws leading to locally
                  distinctive states. Local geometric maps in local
                  frames of reference can be constructed at the
                  control level to serve as observers for control laws
                  in particular neighborhoods. The causal level
                  abstracts continuous behavior among distinctive
                  states into a discrete model consisting of states
                  linked by actions. The topological level introduces
                  the external ontology of places, paths and regions
                  by abduction, to explain the observed pattern of
                  states and actions at the causal level. Quantitative
                  knowledge at the control, causal and topological
                  levels supports a ?atchworkmap?of local geometric
                  frames of reference linked by causal and topological

                  level when sufficient information and computational
                  resources are available. We describe the assumptions

                  Hierarchy that combines their strengths and avoids
                  their weaknesses. Metrical SLAM methods are used to
                  build local maps of small-scale space within the

                  has several advantages that aid online
                  mapbuilding. First, local metrical motion planning
                  and obstacle avoidance can take place within the
                  LPM. Second, metrical localization can be done
                  quickly after entering a place neighborhood, rather
                  than requiring physical hill-climbing to a
                  distinctive pose. If resources needed for metrical
                  localization become unavailable, navigation can fall
                  back on hill-climbing as in the basic SSH. Third,
                  structural ambiguity due to large loops or false

                  different regions of the environment: in the basic

  r-Kuipers08chapter ={Having defined large-scale space as space whose
                  structure is larger than the sensory horizon, it is
                  natural to define small-scale space as space whose
                  structure is within the sensory horizon. Small-scale
                  space is described by a local perceptual map that is
                  metrically accurate and is constructed directly from
                  sensory input. Recently developed SLAM methods are

                  a person has about the spatial structure of a
                  large-scale environment: the ``cognitive map.'' The
                  functions of the cognitive map are to assimilate new
                  information about the environment, to represent the
                  current position, and to answer route-finding and
                  relative-position problems. This model (called the

                  structure of containing regions. The current
                  position is described by the ``You Are Here''
                  pointer, which acts as a working memory and a focus
                  of attention. Operations on the cognitive map are
                  performed by inference rules which act to transfer
                  information among different descriptions and the
                  ``You Are Here'' pointer. The TOUR model shows how
                  the particular descriptions chosen to represent
                  spatial knowledge support assimilation of new
                  information from local observations into the
                  cognitive map, and how the cognitive map solves
                  route-finding and relative-position problems. A
                  central theme of this research is that the states of
                  partial knowledge supported by a representation are
                  responsible for its ability to function with limited
                  information or computational resources. The
                  representations in the TOUR model provide a rich
                  collection of states of partial knowledge, and
                  therefore exhibit flexible, ``common-sense''
                  behavior. },
  r-Kuipers08chapter ={One problem with the original TOUR model is
                  that the procedural level too thoroughly abstracts
                  away the agent? sensory input from the
                  environment. The route-direction-like input
                  representation was unable to express either gaps in
                  the sequence of experience or perceptual aliasing
                  (different places that look the same). .. A second
                  problem with the original TOUR model is that it
                  presupposes that the continuous experience of the
                  agent has already been abstracted to a discrete
                  sequence of states and transitions.},

  abstract =	 {The "Map in the Head" metaphor states that knowledge
                  of large-scale space is isomorphic to the
                  information stored in a graphical map: That is,
                  corresponding operations are used to store and
                  retrieve information. The purpose of this essay is
                  to look carefully at the "Map in the Head" metaphor
                  to see the limits of its applicability. There are
                  two types of experimental results that are difficult
                  to accommodate within this metaphor. First, instead
                  of being integrated into a single map, spatial
                  knowledge can fall into disconnected components,
                  with little or no relation between the
                  components. Second, knowledge of routes (and other
                  spatial facts) may be represented asymmetrically, so
                  that a route can be followed in one direction but
                  not in the other. The first set of results leads us
                  to replace the simple "Map in the Head" with a more
                  complex and sophisticated metaphor including
                  separate metrical and topological components. The
                  second set of results suggests that even the more
                  sophisticated "Map in the Head" is built from
                  computational structures that occasionally reveal
                  their nonmaplike properties. A computational model
                  is presented for assimilating observations gathered
                  during travel, first into a description of the
                  particular route, then into representations for the
                  topological and metrical features of the
                  environment.},

                  a popular method, but is not reliable when a robot
                  travels long distances or over an uneven surface
                  because of variations in wheel diameter and wheel
                  slippage. The landmark method, which estimates the
                  current position relative to landmarks, cannot be
                  used in an uncharted environment. The authors
                  propose a new method called ?�cooperative
                  positioning with multiple robots?? For cooperative
                  positioning, the authors divide the robots into two
                  groups, A and B. One group, say A, remains
                  stationary and acts as a landmark while group B
                  moves. The moving group B then stops and acts as a
                  landmark for group A. This ?�dance??is repeated
                  until the target robot position are
                  reached. Cooperative positioning has a far lower
                  accumulated positioning error than dead reckoning,
                  and can work in three-dimensions which is not
                  possible with dead reckoning. Also, this method has
                  inherent landmarks and therefore works in uncharted
                  environments. This paper discusses the positioning
                  accuracy of the authors' method with error variances

                  to solve the simultaneous localisation and mapping
                  (SLAM) problem with a bearing-only sensor. The main
                  contribution of the paper is to provide a remedy for
                  the landmark initialisation problem that occurs due
                  to the absence of range information, in a
                  computationally efficient manner. Each landmark is
                  initialised in the form of multiple hypotheses
                  distributed along the direction of the bearing
                  measurement. Using subsequent measurements, the
                  validity of the hypotheses is evaluated based on the
                  sequential probability ratio test
                  (SPRT). Consequently, the best approximation to the
                  landmark location is maintained. This approach
                  enables an extended Kalman filler (EKF) to be used
                  for bearing-only SLAM providing a computational
                  efficient solution. Simulation and experimental
                  results, from using a camera as the bearing-only
                  sensor mounted on a Pioneer robot are included to

                  preparation tasks, and here the results are
                  compared. The tasks could be divided into a series
                  of actions performed on objects. The eyes usually
                  reached the next object in the sequence before any
                  sign of manipulative action, indicating that eye
                  movements are planned into the motor pattern and
                  lead each action. The eyes usually fixated the same
                  object throughout the action upon it, although they
                  often moved on to the next object in the sequence
                  before completion of the preceding action. The
                  specific roles of individual fixations could be
                  identified as locating (establishing the locations
                  of objects for future use), directing (establishing
                  target direction prior to contact), guiding
                  (supervising the relative movements of two or three
                  objects) and checking (establishing whether some
                  particular condition is met, prior to the
                  termination of an action). It is argued that, at the
                  beginning of each action, the oculomotor system is
                  supplied with the identity of the required object,
                  information about its location, and instructions
                  about the nature of the monitoring required during
                  the action. The eye movements during this kind of
                  task are nearly all to task-relevant objects, and
                  thus their control is seen as primarily ?op-down?
                  and influenced very little by the ?ntrinsic
                  salience?of objects.},

                  soon as another sense is available to take
                  over. .. Object localization is often a two-stage

                  a combination of fast saccadic eye movements and
                  rather slower head movements. Since the first study
                  on freely moving subjects, most authors have agreed
                  that the head movement component of gaze is very
                  variable, with a high 'volitional' component. But in
                  some circumstances head and eye movements can be
                  quite predictable, for example when a subject is
                  asked to shift gaze as quickly as possible. Under
                  these conditions, laboratory studies have shown that
                  the eye and head motor-systems both receive
                  gaze-change commands, although they execute them in
                  rather different ways. Here I reconsider the way
                  gaze direction is changed during free movement, but
                  in the performance of a task where the subject is
                  too busy to exert conscious control over head or eye
                  movements. Using a new portable and inexpensive
                  method for recording head and eye movements, I
                  examine the oculomotor behaviour of car drivers,
                  particularly during the large gaze changes made at
                  road junctions. The results show that the pattern of
                  eye and head movements is highly preditable, given
                  only the sequence of gaze targets.},

                  changing pattern of the road ahead. There are many
                  theories about what features a driver might use, and
                  recent attempts to engineer self-steering vehicles
                  have sharpened interest in the mechanisms
                  involved. However, there is little direct
                  information linking steering performance to the
                  driver's direction of gaze. We have made
                  simultaneous recordings of steering-wheel angle and
                  drivers' gaze direction during a series of drives
                  along a tortuous road. We found that drivers rely
                  particularly on the 'tangent point' on the inside of
                  each curve, seeking this point 1? s before each bend
                  and returning to it throughout the bend. The
                  direction of this point relative to the car's
                  heading predicts the curvature of the road ahead,
                  and we examine the way this information is used.},

  r-Kim99ep =	 {Land and Lee (1994) reported that drivers rely on
                  the tangent point on the inside of a curve, a
                  strategy similar to the one depicted in Figure
                  2c. The utility of this point appears to be
                  maximized at 1 sec into a bend (> 75\% of the time
                  is spent at fixating this point), after which it
                  degrades rapidly (only 50\% after 2 sec). Donges
                  (1978) suggesed that, for successful steering,
                  drivers need not only information about the
                  curvature of the desired path but information about
                  the vehicle's current position. In a laboratory
                  study based on Land and Lee, Land and Horwood (1995)
                  observed that the crucial portion of the road for
                  successful steering is not the distant part but a
                  portion about 4 to 60 below the horizon of the
                  road. Note that the distant part is where the
                  tangent point is clearly visible, whereas the
                  optimum portion lacks such a point. The results are
                  consistent with Gibson's (1966, 1979/1986) notion of
                  visual kinethesis, the information about the
                  movement of the observer with respect to the
                  environment, provided in optical flow. That is,
                  optical flow contains information about the
                  observer, which in tum is used to correct his or her
                  locomotion (i.e., not only the future path but

  Abstract =	 {Nearly all animals with good vision have a
                  repertoire of eye movements. The majority show a
                  pattern of stable fixations with fast saccades that
                  shift the direction of gaze. These movements may be
                  made by the eyes themselves, or the head, or in some
                  insects the whole body. The main reason for keeping
                  gaze still during fixations is the need to avoid the
                  blur that results from the long response time of the
                  photoreceptors. Blur begins to degrade the image at
                  a retinal velocity of about 1 receptor acceptance
                  angle per response time. Some insects
                  (e.g. hoverflies) stabilise their gaze much more
                  rigidly than this rule implies, and it is suggested
                  that the need to see the motion of small objects
                  against a background imposes even more stringent
                  conditions on image motion. A third reason for
                  preventing rotational image motion is to prevent
                  contamination of the translational flow-field, by
                  which a moving animal can judge its heading and the
                  distances of objects. Some animals do let their eyes
                  rotate smoothly, and these include some heteropod
                  molluscs, mantis shrimps and jumping spiders, all of
                  which have narrow linear retinae which scan across
                  the surroundings. Hymenopteran insects also rotate
                  during orientation flights at speeds of
                  100?00?s. This is just consistent with a blur-free
                  image, as are the scanning speeds of the animals
                  with linear retinae.},

                  function. Our focus is on loss functions based on
                  pairwise coincidences, that is, whether pairs of
                  items are clustered into the same subset or
                  not. Optimisation of the posterior expected loss
                  function can be formulated as a binary integer
                  programming problem, which can be readily solved,
                  for example by the simplex method, when clustering a
                  modest number of items, but quickly becomes
                  impractical as problem scale increases. To combat
                  this, a new heuristic item-swapping algorithm is
                  introduced. This performs well in our numerical
                  experiments, on both simulated and real data
                  examples. The paper includes a comparison of the
                  statistical performance of the (approximate) optimal
                  clustering with earlier methods that are model-based
                  but ad hoc in their detailed definition.}

                  sensor resetting localization, which is an extension
                  of Monte Carlo localization. The algorithm adds
                  sensor based re-sampling to Monte Carlo localization
                  when the robot is lost. Sensor resetting
                  localization (SRL) is robust to modelling errors
                  including unmodelled movements and systematic
                  errors. It can be used in real time on systems with
                  limited computational power. The algorithm has been
                  successfully used on autonomous legged robots in the

                  as a problem of tracking geometric features which
                  occur naturally in the environment. We represent
                  each feature in the map by a location estimate (the
                  feature state vector) and two distinct measures of
                  uncertainty: a covariance matrix to represent
                  uncertainty in feature location, and a credibility
                  measure to represent our belief in the validity of
                  the feature. During each position update cycle,
                  predicted measurements are generated for each
                  geometric feature in the map and compared to actual
                  sensor observations. Successful matches cause a
                  feature's credibility to be increased. Unpredicted
                  observations are used to initialize new geometric
                  features, while unobserved predictions result in a
                  geometric feature's credibility being decreased. We

                  observation and re-acquisition of distinctive visual
                  events, i.e., landmarks. The representation provides
                  the theoretical foundations for a visual memory
                  database that includes coordinate-free, topological
                  representation of relative spatial location, yet
                  smoothly integrates available metric knowledge of
                  relative or absolute angles and distances. .. A key
                  contribution of this work is the realization of true
                  local coordinate systems, and a theory that makes
                  them computationally useful to a sighted mobile
                  robot. Using visually-based local coordinate
                  systems, which we call viewframes, a robot can
                  navigate about its environment, determining its
                  relative location in the world with essentially a
                  constant error. In particular, there is no
                  multiplicative accumulation of error in
                  location. .. Furthermore, humans and animals perform
                  navigation and guidance tasks quite reliably with
                  extremely poor range estimates, and very coarse
                  angular information. .. the notion of a geographic
                  "place" is defined in terms of data about visible
                  landmarks. A place, as a point on the surface of the
                  ground, is defined by the landmarks and spatial
                  relationships between landmarks that can be observed
                  from a fixed location. More generally we can define
                  a place as a region in space, in which a fixed set
                  of landmarks can be observed from anywhere in the
                  region, and relationships between them do not change
                  in some appropriate qualitative sense. Data about

                  of a Case-Based Reasoning methodology for autonomous
                  navigation tasks. It is based on our previous work
                  on a behavior-based robotic system that also
                  employed spatio-temporal case-based reasoning in the
                  selection of behavioral parameters but was not
                  capable of learning new parameterizations. The
                  present method extends the case-based reasoning
                  module by making it capable of learning new and
                  optimizing the existing cases where each case is a
                  set of behavioral parameters. The learning process
                  can either be a separate training process or be part
                  of the mission execution. In either case, the robot
                  learns an optimal parameterization of its behavior
                  for different environments it encounters. The goal
                  of this research is not only to automatically
                  optimize the performance of the robot but also to
                  avoid the manual configuration of behavioral
                  parameters and the initial configuration of a case
                  library, both of which require the user to possess
                  good knowledge of robot behavior and the performance
                  of numerous experiments. The presented method was
                  integrated within a hybrid robot architecture and
                  evaluated in extensive computer simulations, showing
                  a significant increase in the performance over a
                  nonadaptive system and a performance comparable to a
                  non-learning CBR system that uses a hand-coded case

                  build topological representations or generate

                  paper we introduce relational object maps, a novel
                  approach to building metric maps that represent
                  individual objects such as doors or walls. We show
                  how to extend relational Markov networks in order to
                  reason about a hierarchy of objects and the spatial
                  relationships between them. Markov chain Monte Carlo
                  is used for ef cient inference and to learn the
                  parameters of the model. We show that the spatial
                  constraints modeled by our mapping technique yield
                  drastic improvements for labeling line segments

                  relevance reasoning. This framework is based on d

                  efficient techniques for pruning irrelevant parts of
                  a network. Our main contribution is a technique that
                  we call relevance-based
                  decomposition. Relevance-based decomposition
                  approaches belief updating in large networks by
                  focusing on their parts and decomposing them into
                  partially overlapping subnetworks. This makes
                  reasoning in some intractable networks possible and,
                  in addition, often results in significant speedup,
                  as the total time taken to update all subnetworks is
                  in practice often considerably less than the time
                  taken to update the network as a whole. We report
                  results of empirical tests that demonstrate

                  necessary multiplications is low. An important
                  aspect is that the numbering algorithm itself does
                  not require many operations. A. George
                  \cite{George73siam} has found an effective numbering
                  for the system whose graph is a planar square
                  grid. For such a system of $n$ equations the number
                  of multiplications is $O(n^{3/2})$. A planar grid of
                  $n$ nodes collapses when $O(n^{1/2})$ nodes are
                  removed. The authors show that this, and not the
                  sparsity itself, is the property that is sufficient,
                  and also necessary, for the existence of a numbering
                  that gives the $O(n^{3/2})$ multiplication
                  count. So, George's numbering may be applied to the
                  equation system arising from the finite elements
                  method for the two-dimensional problem, giving again
                  $O(n^{3/2})$ multiplications. For a
                  three-dimensional grid, the multiplication count is
                  $O(n^2)$. \{The remark after Theorem 6 should read
                  $\sigma=(d-1)/d$\}. The theorems and some proofs
                  give estimates for the coefficients in the $O(·)$
                  positions.}

                  detection and subsequent local geometric map
                  building. Visual and inertial sensing are two
                  sensory modalities that can be explored to give
                  robust solutions on image segmentation and recovery
                  of 3D structure from images, increasing the
                  capabilities of autonomous vehicles and enlarging
                  the application potential of vision systems. From
                  the inertial sensors, a camera stereo rig, and a few
                  system parameters we can recover the 3D parameters
                  of the ground plane and vertical lines. The
                  homography between stereo images of ground points
                  can be found. By detecting the vertical line
                  segments in each image, and using the homography of
                  ground points for the foot of each segment, the
                  lines can be matched and reconstructed in 3D. The
                  mobile robot then maps the detected vertical line
                  segments in a world map as it moves. To build this
                  map an outlier removal method is implemented and a
                  statistical approach used, so that a simplified
                  metric map can be obtained for robot navigation.},

                  build a world model from sensor measurements. In
                  order to integrate all the frames of sensor data, it
                  is essential to align the data properly. An
                  incremental approach has been typically used in the
                  past, in which each local frame of data is aligned
                  to a cumulative global model, and then merged to the
                  model. Because dierent parts of the model are
                  updated independently while there are errors in the
                  registration, such an approach may result in an
                  inconsistent model. In this paper, we study the
                  problem of consistent registration of multiple
                  frames of measurements (range scans), together with
                  the related issues of representation and
                  manipulation of spatial uncertainties. Our approach
                  is to maintain all the local frames of data as well
                  as the relative spatial relationships between local
                  frames. These spatial relationships are modeled as
                  random variables and are derived from matching
                  pairwise scans or from odometry. Then we formulate a
                  procedure based on the maximum likelihood criterion
                  to optimally combine all the spatial
                  relations. Consistency is achieved by using all the
                  spatial relations as constraints to solve for the
                  data frame poses simultaneously. Experiments with

  r-Kuipers77thesis ={Kevin Lynch's delightful book [] was responsible
                  for the recent surge of interest in mental images of
                  the environment. One central point is that the
                  mental image can be decomposed into symbolic
                  elements, and is not necessarily pictorial in nature
                  or properties. He distinguishes between the
                  qualities of imageability and legibility of an
                  environment. Imageability concerns the sensory
                  aspects of the environment and how its landmarks
                  evoke strong reactions. Legibility concerns the
                  structural aspects of the environment and how a
                  traveler can find his way around in it. The
                  properties that determine legibility are the ones
                  addressed by this research. .. Lynch decomposed the
                  knowledge in the cognitive map into five elements:
                  landmarks, nodes, paths, edges, and districts. Their
                  functions and relation- ships correspond roughly
                  with those of places, paths, and regions in the TOUR
                  model.},

                  factorization modifications are used to maintain a

                  beds. Loop-closure observations produced by a stereo

                  stated for a feature represented by a general
                  probability density function. Several specific
                  representations are then considered -- Gaussian,

                  algorithms for these representations are shown to

                  taking the log, probabilities are transformed in

  TITLE =	 "Convolutional Factor Graphs as Probabilistic Models",
  crossref =	 "_UAI04",
  PAGES =	 "374-38",
  abstract =	 {Based on a recent development in the area of error
                  control coding, we introduce the notion of
                  convolutional factor graphs (CFGs) as a new class of
                  probabilistic graphical models. In this context, the
                  conventional factor graphs are referred to as
                  multiplicative factor graphs (MFGs). This paper
                  shows that CFGs are natural models for probability
                  functions when summation of independent latent
                  random variables is involved. In particular, CFGs
                  capture a large class of linear models, where the
                  linearity is in the sense that the observed
                  variables are obtained as a linear transformation of
                  the latent variables taking arbitrary
                  distributions. We use Gaussian models and
                  independent factor models as examples to demonstrate
                  the use of CFGs. The requirement of a linear
                  transformation between latent variables (with
                  certain independence restriction) and the observed
                  variables, to an extent, limits the modelling
                  flexibility of CFGs. This structural restriction
                  however provides a powerful analytic tool to the
                  framework of CFGs; that is, upon taking the Fourier
                  transform of the function represented by the CFG,
                  the resulting function is represented by a MFG with
                  identical structure. This Fourier transform duality
                  allows inference problems on a CFG to be solved on
                  the corresponding dual MFG.},

                  use dense stereo vision to measure the variance of
                  the heights in each cell of a 2D grid. Unlike other
                  grid-based SLAM algorithms, which use occupancy grid
                  maps, our algorithm uses a new mapping technique
                  that maintains a posterior distribution over the
                  height variance in each cell. To obtain a joint
                  posterior over poses and maps, we use a
                  Rao-Blackwellized particle filter: the pose
                  distribution is estimated using a particle filter,
                  and each particle has its own map that is obtained

                  odometry (VO) provides good proposal

                  gamma distribution over the precision (inverse

                  demonstrate performance on two outdoor courses, and

                  foreground detection algorithms. Processing of
                  foreground images in surveillance applications
                  typically requires that such shadows have been
                  identified and removed from the detected
                  foreground. This paper presents a novel pixel-based
                  statistical approach to model moving cast shadows of
                  non-uniform and varying intensity. This approach
                  uses the Gaussian mixture model (GMM) learning
                  ability to build statistical models describing
                  moving cast shadows on surfaces. This statistical
                  modeling can deal with scenes with complex and
                  time-varying illumination, and prevent false
                  detection in regions where shadows cannot be
                  detected. Gaussian mixture shadow models (GMSM) are
                  automatically constructed and updated over time, are
                  easily added to a GMM architecture for foreground
                  detection, and require only a small number of
                  parameters. Results obtained with different scene
                  types show the robustness of the approach. },

                  build a robot that concatenated different wall and
                  midline following behaviours to routes and
                  graphs. The robot was equipped with a ring of
                  ultrasonic sensors and a compass. It executed a
                  single behaviour as long as the sensory conditions
                  remained qualitatively the same, e.g., as long as
                  the robot? ultrasonic sensors detected a corridor
                  leading into the south. A new behaviour was
                  triggered by arriving at a distinctive place showing
                  a qualitative change of the immediate environment
                  such as a corner or a dead end. In contrast to the
                  other approaches, the recognition of these places
                  was only determined by their context, i.e., by the
                  sequence of actions preceding the current
                  action. Thus, the only information stored in the
                  graph representation were actions, not place
                  descriptions. In the graph, each action was labelled
                  by the type of the local environment and by the
                  navigation behaviour used to traverse it (e.g.,
                  follow left wall heading south). These features
                  allowed the robot to acquire routes autonomously by
                  simply following the walls of the experimental
                  room. Routes were integrated as soon as the robot
                  encountered a previously visited local environment
                  requiring the same local navigation behaviour. This
                  shows a limitation of Matari�c? approach: The number
                  of uniquely identifiable combinations of wall type
                  and compass direction is small. In general
                  environments, the problem of perceptual aliasing
                  arises, i.e., distinct locations appear identical to
                  the robot? sensors [55]. Arriving at a new situation
                  identical to an already stored one, Matari�c? robot
                  would perform a false route integration. Thus, the
                  navigable environment remained confined to rooms
                  with a uniquely identifiable wall configuration.},

                  possible is in driving, where McCallum (1995)
                  demonstrated that a very limited set of sensory
                  information was sufficient to allow a simulated
                  vehicle to learn to drive successfully on a freeway,
                  passing slower cars in front and avoiding faster
                  cars behind. .. The work ofMcCallum (1995),

                  can learn a minimal set of perception?ction
                  sequences appropriate for freeway driving. This can
                  be modelled as a partially observable Markov

                  illumination and viewpoint variations. These
                  descriptors are extracted from video and then
                  applied to the challenging task of wide baseline
                  matching across significant viewpoint changes. The
                  system incorporates a single camera on a mobile
                  robot in an extended Kalman filter framework to
                  develop a 3D map of the environment and determine
                  egomotion. At the same time, the feature descriptors
                  are generated from the video sequence, which can be
                  used to localize the robot when it returns to a
                  mapped location. The kidnapped robot problem is
                  addressed by matching descriptors without any
                  estimate of position, then determining the epipolar

                  many vision systems. Existing work in the area has
                  mostly addressed scenes that consist of static or
                  quasi-static structures. When the scene exhibits a
                  persistent dynamic behavior in time, such an
                  assumption is violated and detection performance
                  deteriorates. In this paper, we propose a new method
                  for the modeling and subtraction of such
                  scenes. Towards the modeling of the dynamic
                  characteristics, optical flow is computed and
                  utilized as a feature in a higher dimensional
                  space. Inherent ambiguities in the computation of
                  features are addressed by using a data-dependent
                  bandwidth for density estimation using
                  kernels. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
                  utility and performance of the proposed approach.},

                  nent in motion analysis. The central idea behind
                  such module is to create a probabilistic
                  representation of the static scene that is compared
                  with the current input to perform subtraction. Such
                  approach is efficient when the scene to be modeled
                  refers to a static structure with limited
                  perturbation. In this paper, we address the problem
                  of modeling dynamic scenes where the assumption of a
                  static background is not valid. Waving trees,
                  beaches, escalators, natural scenes with rain or
                  snow are examples. We propose an on-line
                  auto-regressive model to capture and predict the
                  behavior of such scenes. Towards detection of events
                  we introduce a new metric that is based on a
                  state-driven comparison between the prediction and
                  the actual frame. Promising results demonstrate the
                  potentials of the proposed framework.},

                  constraints is here considered, mainly for picture
                  processing purposes. A systematic specification and
                  utilization of the available constraints could
                  significantly reduce the amount of search in picture
                  recognition. On the other hand, formally stated
                  constraints can be embedded in the syntactic
                  productions of picture languages. Only binary
                  constraints are treated here, but they are
                  represented in full generality as binary
                  relations. Constraints among more than two variables
                  are then represented as networks of simultaneous
                  binary relations. In general, more than one
                  equivalent (i.e., representing the same constraint)
                  network can be found: a minimal equivalent network
                  is shown to exist, and its computation is shown to
                  solve most practical problems about constraint
                  handling. No exact solution for this central problem
                  was found. Anyway, constraints are treated
                  algebraically, and the solution of a system of
                  linear equations in this algebra provides an
                  approximation of the minimal network. This solution
                  is then proved exact in special cases, e.g., for
                  tree-like and series-parallel networks and for
                  classes of relations for which a distributive
                  property holds. This latter condition is satisfied

  abstract =	 {The ability to simultaneously localize a robot and
                  accurately map its surroundings is considered by
                  many to be a key prerequisite of truly autonomous
                  robots. However, few approaches to this problem
                  scale up to handle the very large number of
                  landmarks present in real environments. Kalman
                  filter-based algorithms, for example, require time
                  quadratic in the number of landmarks to incorporate
                  each sensor observation. This paper presents
                  FastSLAM, an algorithm that recursively estimates
                  the full posterior distribution over robot pose and
                  landmark locations, yet scales logarithmically with
                  the number of landmarks in the map. This algorithm
                  is based on an exact factorization of the posterior
                  into a product of conditional landmark distributions
                  and a distribution over robot paths. The algorithm
                  has been run successfully on as many as 50,000
                  landmarks, environments far beyond the reach of
                  previous approaches. Experimental results

                  localization and mapping even in the 'pure vision'
                  domain of a single agile camera with no extra
                  sensing. An issue which has caused difficulty in
                  monocular SLAM however is the initialization of
                  features, since information from multiple images
                  acquired during motion must be combined to achieve
                  accurate depth estimates. This has led algorithms to
                  deviate from the desirable Gaussian uncertainty
                  representation of the EKF and related probabilistic
                  filters during special initialization steps. In this
                  paper we present a new unified parametrization for
                  point features within monocular SLAM which permits
                  efficient and accurate representation of uncertainty

                  of inverse depth, where there is a high degree of
                  linearity. Importantly, our parametrization can cope
                  with features which are so far from the camera that
                  they present little parallax during motion,
                  maintaining sufficient representative uncertainty
                  that these points retain the opportunity to 'come
                  in' from infinity if the camera makes larger
                  movements. We demonstrate the parametrization using

                  relationship between these views. The views are
                  represented through their SIFT keypoints. The

                  distinct challenges due to the various uncertainties
                  in the robot sensing and action. In particular,
                  global positioning sensors of outdoor robots do not
                  always work perfectly, causing large drift in the
                  location estimate of the robot. To overcome this
                  common problem, we propose a new approach for global
                  localization using place recognition. First, we
                  learn the location of some arbitrary key places
                  using odometry measurements and GPS measurements
                  only at the start and the end of the robot
                  trajectory. In subsequent runs, when the robot
                  perceives a key place, our fixed-lag smoother fuses
                  odometry measurements with the relative location to
                  the key place to improve its pose estimate. Outdoor
                  mobile robot experiments show that place recognition
                  measurements significantly improve the estimate of
                  the smoother in the absence of GPS measurements.},

                  to a new heading (updating), and after
                  disorientation (disorientation). The internal
                  consistency of pointing in the disorientation
                  condition was relatively high and equivalent to that
                  in the baseline and updating conditions, when the
                  layout had salient intrinsic axes and the
                  participants learned the locations of the objects on
                  the periphery of the layout. The internal
                  consistency of pointing was disrupted by
                  disorientation when participants learned the
                  locations of objects while standing amid them and
                  the layout did not have salient intrinsic axes. It
                  was also observed that many participants retrieved
                  spatial relations after disorientation from the
                  original learning heading. These results indicate
                  that people form an allocentric representation of
                  object-to-object spatial relations when they learn
                  the layout of a novel environment and use that
                  representation to locate objects around
                  them. Egocentric representations may be used to
                  locate objects when allocentric representations are

  abstract =	 {In this paper, the problem of fully decentralized
                  data fusion and control for a modular wheeled mobile
                  robot (WMR) is addressed. This is a vehicle system
                  with nonlinear kinematics, distributed multiple
                  sensors, and nonlinear sensor models. The problem is
                  solved by applying fully decentralized estimation
                  and control algorithms based on the extended
                  information filter. This is achieved by deriving a
                  modular, decentralized kinematic model by using
                  plane motion kinematics to obtain the forward and
                  inverse kinematics for a generalized simple wheeled
                  vehicle. This model is then used in the
                  decentralized estimation and control algorithms. WMR
                  estimation and control is thus obtained locally
                  using reduced order models with reduced
                  communication requirements, in a scalable network of
                  control nodes. If communication of information
                  between nodes is carried out after every measurement
                  (full rate communication), the estimates and control
                  signals obtained at each node are equivalent to
                  those obtained by a corresponding centralized
                  system. Transputer architecture is used as the basis
                  for hardware and software design as it supports the
                  extensive communication and concurrency requirements
                  that characterize modular and decentralized
                  systems. The advantages of a modular WMR vehicle
                  include scalability, application flexibility, low
                  prototyping costs, and high reliability.},

                  vision assume that the scene and the sources are
                  immersed in pure air and that light is neither
                  scattered nor absorbed. Recently, however,
                  structured lighting has found growing application in
                  underwater and aerial imaging, where scattering
                  effects cannot be ignored. In this paper, we present
                  a comprehensive analysis of two representative
                  methods - light stripe range scanning and
                  photometric stereo - in the presence of
                  scattering. For both methods, we derive physical
                  models for the appearances of a surface immersed in
                  a scattering medium. Based on these models, we
                  present results on (a) the condition for object
                  detectability in light striping and (b) the number
                  of sources required for photometric stereo. In both
                  cases, we demonstrate that while traditional methods
                  fail when scattering is significant, our methods
                  accurately recover the scene (depths, normals,
                  albedos) as well as the properties of the
                  medium. These results are in turn used to restore
                  the appearances of scenes as if they were captured
                  in clear air. Although we have focused on light
                  striping and photometric stereo, our approach can
                  also be extended to other methods such as grid
                  coding, gated and active polarization imaging.},

                  best match for one feature, reestimates the state,
                  and continues with the next features. However, state
                  reestimation is expensive and the result can be
                  incorrect, one reason being that the resulting
                  hypothesis depends on the order in which the
                  features are considered. Finally proposes Joint
                  Compatibility Branch and Bound (JCBB) that performs
                  a search for the hypothesis that contains the
                  largest number of jointly compatible pairings, while
                  avoiding state reestimation. However, the joint
                  innovation test that is needed is potentially
                  expensive, and approximations are applied to allow
                  incremental evaluation. The search is bounded by the
                  monotonically nondecreasing quality measure of a
                  node by the number of nonnull pairings that can be

                  guides itself to a particular location on the basis
                  of sensory input. In this paper, a method of visual
                  homing using an associative memory based on a simple

                  learned visual patterns and system motor

                  theoretical analysis of the associative memory used
                  in his approach. Instead of a mobile robot, Nelson
                  used a small camera mounted on a robot arm which
                  could move at a fixed height over a miniature city
                  called ?inytown? Places were recognized from the
                  bird? eye view of the camera. Each camera image of a
                  location was divided into a 5 ?5 grid of adjacent
                  subwindows in which the predominant edge direction
                  was determined. In the training phase, Nelson?
                  system learned associations between local edge
                  orientation patterns with directions towards the
                  goal in the town centre at 120 preselected places
                  covering Tinytown. Homing was accomplished by
                  comparing the currently perceived pattern against
                  all patterns stored in the associative memory, and
                  moving into the specified direction of the winning
                  pattern. Nelson? system was able to find the goal
                  from almost all places in Tinytown and thus

                  recognition-triggered responses in robot
                  applications. However, his system relied on some
                  idealizations: pictures were taken in exactly the
                  same camera orientation, the system had to be
                  trained at all possible locations and could not

                  building (SLAM) problem. Closed form solutions are
                  presented in both state space and information based
                  forms. A key conclusion of this paper is that the
                  information-state based form offers many advantages
                  over the state space formulation in allowing the
                  SLAM algorithm to be decentralised across multiple
                  platforms. The benefits of operating SLAM in an
                  information form are numerous. The additive
                  properties of the information update make it
                  especially attractive, as does the ability to
                  predict estimates through any direction in
                  time. However, of paramount importance is the
                  well-known ability to decentralise the information
                  filter. A general form of the continuous time
                  inverse covariance matrix for the SLAM problem is
                  presented to determine such properties as the
                  initial and steady state conditions. These
                  properties are investigated to determine their
                  dependence and relationship to both the observation
                  and process noise. Examination of the structure of
                  the general form of the inverse covariance matrix
                  also gives an insight into what information should
                  be communicated between platforms in the
                  decentralised architecture and how it can be
                  managed. },
  c-Rosencrantz03uai ={In a recent result [this], it was shown that
                  scalable decentralized state estimation can be
                  achieved for static environments with Gaussian error
                  - that is, environments where the state does not
                  change over time and observations are
                  (approximately) linear functions of the state with
                  Gaussian error. The key insight in [this] is that in
                  static worlds, information can be accumulated at any
                  time and in any order, regardless of the time at
                  which it was acquired. Furthermore, because of the
                  simple form of the observations, there is a simple
                  algorithm for accumulating local evidence in the
                  form of additive information
                  matrices. Unfortunately, the "trick" of additive
                  information works only for distributions (such as
                  Gaussians) which are in the exponential family.},

                  latency and bandwidth limitations such as typically
                  found in airborne vehicle applications. The key idea
                  is to represent maps in information form (negative
                  log-likelihood), and to selectively communicate
                  subsets of the information tailored to the available
                  communication resources. We show that our

                  which has important ramifications for data

                  delay and the motion estimates are used for
                  navigational purposes. The front end of the system
                  is a feature tracker. Point features are matched
                  between pairs of frames and linked into image
                  trajectories at video rate. Robust estimates of the
                  camera motion are then produced from the feature
                  tracks using a geometric hypothesize-and-test
                  architecture. This generates what we call visual
                  odometry, i.e. motion estimates from visual input
                  alone. No prior knowledge of the scene nor the

                  that differs between monocular and stereo

                  decisions regarding the confidence of a motion
                  estimate, since we must otherwise accept the
                  estimate without any knowledge of the probability
                  that the estimate is in error. For example, we may
                  wish to fuse visual estimates with information from
                  GPS and inertial sensors, but without uncertainty
                  information, we have no principled way to do
                  so. Ideally, we would perform a full search over the
                  7-dimensional space of fundamental matrices to yield
                  an estimate and its related uncertainty. However,
                  searching this space is computationally
                  infeasible. As a compromise between fully
                  representing posterior likelihood over this space
                  and producing a single estimate, we represent the
                  uncertainty over the space of translation directions
                  in a calibrated framework. In contrast to finding a
                  single estimate, representing the posterior
                  likelihood is always a well-posed problem, albeit an
                  often computationally challenging one. Given the
                  posterior likelihood, we derive a confidence
                  interval around the motion estimate. We verify the
                  correctness of the confidence interval using
                  synthetic data and show examples of uncertainty
                  estimates using vehicle-mounted camera sequences.},

                  designed features of the environment aid people in
                  creating an effective mental image, or "cognitive
                  map" of the spatial relationships within a building,
                  and the subsequent ease of wayfinding within the
                  environment. However, little research has attempted
                  to operationalize legibility by examining the
                  relationship between objective measures of the
                  physical environment, the cognitive map, and
                  observational measures of wayfinding
                  performance. This article empirically assesses the
                  effects of one environmental variable, topological
                  floor plan complexity, on the cognitive mapping and
                  wayfinding performance of 63 participants within
                  three building settings. The study finds that this
                  objective measure of floor plan complexity
                  significantly influences cognitive mapping and
                  observed wayfinding. Given these results, a
                  conceptual model of one aspect of architectural
                  legibility was developed and empirically
                  tested. Path analysis was used to assess the
                  relationship between topological plan configuration,
                  four convergent measures of the cognitive map, and
                  observational measures of human wayfinding
                  performance. Analysis of these data provide support
                  for the conceptual model. The model suggests that
                  the complexity of topological plan configuration
                  influences legibility. The evidence also indicates
                  that the relationship between plan configuration and

                  surveillance systems. One dificult problem when
                  using the process is maintaining a correct
                  background image against changing illumination
                  conditions. Most methods for maintaining the
                  background image are based on intuitive definitions
                  about the illumination change and are implemented as
                  somewhat ad hoc algorithms. In contrast, we first
                  define mathematical models representing the relation
                  between the illumination intensity, a rejection
                  index of objects and a pixel value. We also
                  mathematically define an assumption about
                  illumination, which requires that the distribution
                  of the illumination intensity in a small region does
                  not change Then we formalize the background
                  subtraction problem as a statistical test based on
                  the models and assunip tion. The experinients show
                  that our models appropriately express the imaging
                  process of a camera and our method' provides stable
                  detection performance for foreground objects.},

                  learning system for modeling and recognizing human
                  behaviors in a visual surveillance task. The system
                  is particularly concerned with detecting when
                  interactions between people occur and classifying
                  the type of interaction. Examples of interesting
                  interaction behaviors include following another
                  person, altering one's path to meet another, and so
                  forth. Our system combines top-down with bottom-up
                  information in a closed feedback loop, with both
                  components employing a statistical Bayesian
                  approach. We propose and compare two different
                  state-based learning architectures, namely, HMMs and
                  CHMMs for modeling behaviors and interactions. The
                  CHMM model is shown to work much more efficiently

                  training system is used to develop flexible prior
                  models for recognizing human interactions. We

                  estimates to produce a map and a robot
                  trajectory. The constraints are generally
                  non-linear, thus SLAM can be viewed as a non-linear
                  optimization problem. The optimization can be
                  difficult, due to poor initial estimates arising
                  from odometry data, and due to the size of the state

                  trajectory, even when given a poor initial

                  detect moving objects in video taken from a static
                  camera and is used for various important
                  applications such as video surveillance, human
                  motion analysis, etc. Various statistical approaches
                  have been proposed for modeling a given scene
                  background. However, there is no theoretical
                  framework for choosing which features to use to
                  model different regions of the scene background. In
                  this paper we introduce a novel framework for
                  feature selection for background modeling and
                  subtraction. A boosting algorithm, namely RealBoost,
                  is used to choose the best combination of features
                  at each pixel. Given the probability estimates from
                  a pool of features calculated by Kernel Density
                  Estimate (KDE) over a certain time period, the
                  algorithm selects the most useful ones to
                  discriminate foreground objects from the scene
                  background. The results show that the proposed
                  framework successfully selects appropriate features

                  fundamental problem in mobile robotics: while a
                  robot navigates in an unknown environment, it must
                  incrementally build a map of its surroundings and,
                  at the same time, localize itself within that
                  map. One popular solution is to treat SLAM as an
                  estimation problem and apply the Kalman filter; this
                  approach is elegant, but it does not scale well: the
                  size of the belief state and the time complexity of
                  the filter update both grow quadratically in the
                  number of landmarks in the map. This paper presents
                  a filtering technique that maintains a tractable
                  approximation of the belief state as a thin junction
                  tree. The junction tree grows under filter updates
                  and is periodically "thinned" via efficient maximum
                  likelihood projections so inference remains
                  tractable. When applied to the SLAM problem, these
                  thin junction tree filters have a linearspace belief
                  state and a linear-time filtering operation. Further
                  approximation yields a filtering operation that is
                  often constant-time. Experiments on a suite of SLAM
                  problems validate the approach.},

                  teams of mobile robots. Inference algorithms that
                  use message passing are a natural fit for
                  distributed systems, but they must be robust to the
                  failure situations that arise in real-world
                  settings, such as unreliable communication and node
                  failures. Unfortunately, the popular sum-product
                  algorithm can yield very poor estimates in these
                  settings because the nodes' beliefs before
                  convergence can be arbitrarily different from the
                  correct posteriors. In this paper, we present a new
                  message passing algorithm for probabilistic
                  inference which provides several crucial guarantees

                  complexity of the message passing updates depends
                  only upon the model, and is independent of the
                  network topology of the distributed system. We

                  conclusion that is consistent with local information
                  known to each node. A large class of these problems
                  - including probabilistic inference, regression, and
                  control problems - can be solved by message passing
                  on a data structure called a junction tree. In this
                  paper, we present a distributed architecture for
                  solving these problems that is robust to unreliable
                  communication and node failures. In this
                  architecture, the nodes of the sensor network
                  assemble themselves into a junction tree and
                  exchange messages between neighbors to solve the

                  to minimize the communication and computation

                  information, respectively. Unlike other vision only
                  SLAM systems, stereo does not suffer from ?cale
                  drift?because of unobservability problems, and thus
                  no other information such as gyroscopes or
                  accelerometers is required. Our SLAM algorithm
                  generates sequences of conditionally independent
                  local maps that can share information related to the
                  camera motion and common features being tracked. The
                  system computes the full map using the Divide and
                  Conquer algorithm adapted for conditionally
                  independent local maps, allowing linear time
                  execution. We show experimental results in outdoor
                  urban environments that demonstrate the robustness
                  and scalability of our system.},

                  representations combining the strengths of

                  representations often facilitate multi-agent
                  mapping. In this paper, a successful SLAM method is
                  presented, which is inspired by the manifold data
                  structure by Howard et al. This method maintains a
                  graph with sensor observations stored in vertices
                  and pose differences including uncertainty
                  information stored in edges. Through its graph
                  structure, updates are local and can be efficiently
                  communicated to peers. The graph links represent
                  known traversable space, and facilitate tasks like
                  path planning. We demonstrate that our SLAM method
                  produces very detailed maps without sacrificing
                  scalability. The presented method was used by the
                  UvA Rescue Virtual Robots team, which won the Best

                  vast optical surveys of the ocean floor. Scientists
                  value these surveys since optical images offer high
                  levels of detail and are easily interpreted by
                  humans. Unfortunately, the coverage of a single
                  image is limited by absorption and backscatter while
                  what is generally desired is an overall view of the
                  survey area. Recent works on underwater mosaics
                  assume planar scenes and are applicable only to
                  situations without much relief. We present a
                  complete and validated system for processing optical
                  images acquired from an underwater robotic vehicle
                  to form a 3D reconstruction of the ocean floor. Our
                  approach is designed for the most general conditions
                  of wide-baseline imagery (low overlap and presence
                  of significant 3D structure) and scales to hundreds
                  or thousands of images. We only assume a calibrated
                  camera system and a vehicle with uncertain and
                  possibly drifting pose information (e.g., a compass,
                  depth sensor, and a Doppler velocity log). Our
                  approach is based on a combination of techniques
                  from computer vision, photogrammetry, and
                  robotics. We use a local to global approach to
                  structure from motion, aided by the navigation
                  sensors on the vehicle to generate 3D
                  sub-maps. These sub-maps are then placed in a common
                  reference frame that is refined by matching
                  overlapping sub-maps. The final stage of processing
                  is a bundle adjustment that provides the 3D
                  structure, camera poses, and uncertainty estimates
                  in a consistent reference frame. We present results
                  with ground truth for structure as well as results
                  from an oceanographic survey over a coral reef.},

                  objects on the basis of their shape poses at least
                  two difficult problems. First, there is the problem
                  of variable illumination, which can be addressed by
                  working with relatively stable features such as
                  intensity edges rather than the raw intensity
                  images. Second, there is the problem of the
                  initially unknown pose of the object relative to the
                  viewer. In one approach to this problem, a
                  hypothesis is first made about the viewpoint, then
                  the appearance of a model object from such a
                  viewpoint is computed and compared with the actual
                  image. Such recognition schemes generally employ 3-D
                  models of objects, but the automatic learning of 3-D
                  models is itself a difficult problem. To address
                  this problem in computational vision, we have
                  developed a scheme, based on the theory of
                  approximation of multivariate functions, that learns
                  from a small set of perspective views a function
                  mapping any viewpoint to a standard view. A network
                  equivalent to this scheme will thus 'recognize' the
                  object on which it was trained from any viewpoint.},

                  of the statistical prevalence of the shadowed
                  regions over the object regions. We model shadows
                  using multivariate Gaussians. We apply a weak
                  classifier as a prefilter. We project shadow models
                  into a quantized color space to update a shadow flow
                  function. We use shadow flow, background models, and
                  current frame to determine the shadow and object
                  regions. This method has several advantages: It does
                  not require a color space transformation. We pose
                  the problem in the RGB color space, and we can carry
                  out the same analysis in other Cartesian spaces as
                  well. It is data-driven and adapts to the changing
                  shadow conditions. In other words, accuracy of our
                  method is not limited by the preset
                  values. Furthermore, it does not assume any 3D
                  models for the target objects or tracking of the
                  cast shadows between frames. Our results show that

                  applications. One of the key factors in enhancing
                  the robustness of dynamic scene analysis is that of
                  accurate and reliable means for shadow
                  detection. Shadow detection is critical for correct
                  object detection in image sequences. Many algorithms

                  shadows. However, a comparative evaluation of the

                  the full range of problems underlying the shadow

                  systems. Moving shadow detection is critical for
                  accurate object detection in video streams since
                  shadow points are often misclassified as object
                  points, causing errors in segmentation and

                  the literature in four classes two of them are

                  of camera motions for which epipolar geometry and
                  image correspondences can be computed
                  automatically. This facilitates matching between
                  quite disparate views-wide baseline stereo. Two
                  extensions are made to the current small baseline
                  algorithms: first, and most importantly, a viewpoint
                  invariant measure is developed for assessing the
                  affinity of corner neighbourhoods over image pairs;
                  second, algorithms are given for generating putative
                  corner matches between image pairs using local
                  homographies. Two novel infrastructure developments
                  are also described: the automatic generation of
                  local homographies, and the combination of possibly
                  conflicting sets of matches prior to RANSAC
                  estimation. The wide baseline matching algorithm is
                  demonstrated on a number of image pairs with varying
                  relative motion, and for different scene types. All

                  general purpose methods exist for topological

                  are superior to the more common filtering approaches
                  in being exact, better equipped to deal with
                  non-linearities, and computing the entire robot
                  trajectory. However, while filtering algorithms that
                  perform map updates in constant time exist, no
                  analogous smoothing method is available. We aim to
                  rectify this situation by presenting a
                  smoothingbased solution to SLAM using Loopy Belief
                  Propagation (LBP) that can perform the trajectory
                  and map updates in constant time except when a loop
                  is closed in the environment. The SLAM problem is
                  represented as a Gaussian Markov Random Field (GMRF)
                  over which LBP is performed. We prove that LBP, in
                  this case, is equivalent to Gauss-Seidel relaxation
                  of a linear system. The inability to compute
                  marginal covariances efficiently in a smoothing
                  algorithm has previously been a stumbling block to
                  their widespread use. LBP enables the efficient
                  recovery of the marginal covariances, albeit
                  approximately, of landmarks and poses. While the
                  final covariances are overconfident, the ones
                  obtained from a spanning tree of the GMRF are
                  conservative, making them useful for data
                  association. Experiments in simulation and using
                  real data are presented.},

                  multiple asynchronous measurement sources in an

                  filtering},
  Volume =	 138,
  Year =	 1991,
  Abstract =	 {An algorithm that achieves complete decentralisation
                  of the Kalman filter algorithm amongst the sensing
                  nodes of a multisensor system is preserved. This
                  algorithm does not require any form of central
                  processing facility or centralised communications
                  medium. Each sensing node implements its own local
                  Kalman filter to arrive at a partial decision which
                  it then broadcasts to every other node. Each node
                  then assimilates this received information to arrive
                  at its own local estimate of the system state. The
                  algorithm guarantees that each local estimate thus
                  obtained is identical to the estimate that would be
                  obtained if a conventional, completely centralised,
                  Kalman filter were used. Because there is no single
                  central processing node the algorithm is highly
                  resilient to loss of one or more sensing nodes. The

  c-DurrantWhyte01fusion ={Work on decentralised systems began in 1989
                  as part of the ESPRIT project SKIDS. In the SKIDS
                  project, a fully decentralised surveillance system
                  was implemented using four cameras and a Transputer
                  based architecture. The network was a
                  fully-connected point-to-point topology. The system
                  was capable of tracking multiple targets (humans and
                  robots) and addressed such issues as decentralised
                  data association and decentralised
                  identification. The SKIDS demonstrator, which
                  continued to be refined and operated for almost 10
                  years, laid the basis for all subsequent work on
                  decentralised data fusion.}

  Year =	 1991,
  Abstract =	 {We present two algorithms for tracking and
                  identification in decentralized multi-sensor
                  systems. Decentralized architectures have many
                  benefits in terms of modularity, speed and
                  robustness. The state estimation (tracking)
                  algorithm is a decentralized Kalman filter (DKF)
                  based on the extended Kalman filter. Identification
                  is achieved by the decentralized Bayesian
                  identification (DBI) algorithm, which identifies
                  targets being tracked. For each of the algorithms
                  The authors discuss optimality and the effect of
                  reducing connectivity. The structure of the
                  algorithms leads to the development of an
                  architecture for a modular sensing node based on
                  communication considerations. The authors present
                  example implementations of both algorithms on actual
                  transputer-based sensing nodes. They describe RCD
                  (region of constant depth) tracking and for this
                  develop a monopulse sonar arrangement with which
                  they implement real-time autonomous tracking by a
                  single sensor node. The second example
                  implementation describes identification of targets
                  being tracked by the DKF using the DBI on actual CCD
                  camera-based nodes},
  c-dellaert =	 {DBI is a second phase to do a classification of
                  targets, and has the same structure as the DKF, but
                  is for discrete variables. Not clear how well it is
                  understood by the authors that DKF is just an
                  instance of DBI (although, I did not fully check
                  that: I'm assuming they did it right).},

                  development of a decentralised air and ground
                  sensing network for target tracking and
                  identification. The theoretical methods employed for
                  studying decentralised data fusion problems are
                  based on the information-filter formulation of the
                  Kalman filter algorithm and on information-theoretic
                  methods derived from the Bayes theorem. The paper
                  particularly focuses on how these methods are
                  applied in very large heterogeneous sensor networks,
                  where there may be a significant amount of data
                  delay or corruption in communication. This paper
                  then describes the development of a practical system
                  aimed at demonstrating some of these principles. The
                  system consists of a number of unmanned air vehicles

                  observe a number of ground targets. The UAV sensor
                  payloads are constructed in a modular fashion, with
                  the ability to communicate in a network with both
                  other air-borne and other ground sensors. The ground
                  sensor system comprises of multiple modular sensing
                  nodes which include vision scanned laser, steerable
                  radar, multiple fixed radar arrays, and combined

                  positive definite matrix $M$ that is sparse (many

                  solve a system equivalent to $Mx=b$ by Gaussian

                  discussed this question when $M$ was represented by
                  a tree, and he showed that an ordering $P$ could be

                  exclusively studied independent of any specific
                  ongoing task and limited to two-dimensional picture
                  viewing. This contrasts with its use in everyday
                  life, which mostly consists of purposeful tasks
                  where gaze is crucially involved. To better
                  understand deployment of gaze under such
                  circumstances, we devised a series of experiments,
                  in which subjects navigated along a walkway in a
                  virtual environment and executed combinations of
                  approach and avoidance tasks. The position of the
                  body and the gaze were monitored during the
                  execution of the task combinations and dependence of
                  gaze on the ongoing tasks as well as the visual
                  features of the scene was analyzed. Gaze
                  distributions were compared to a random gaze
                  allocation strategy as well as a specific ?aliency
                  model.?Gaze distributions showed high similarity
                  across subjects. Moreover, the precise fixation
                  locations on the objects depended on the ongoing
                  task to the point that the specific tasks could be
                  predicted from the subject? fixation data. By
                  contrast, gaze allocation according to a random or a
                  saliency model did not predict the executed
                  fixations or the observed dependence of fixation
                  locations on the specific task.},

  Abstract =	 {We present a new approach to the problem of
                  simultaneously localizing a group of mobile robots
                  capable of sensing each other. Each of the robots
                  collects sensor data regarding its own motion and
                  shares this information with the rest of the team
                  during the update cycles. A single estimator, in the
                  form of a Kalman filter, processes the available
                  positioning information from all the members of the
                  team and produces a pose estimate for each of
                  them. The equations for this centralized estimator
                  can be written in a decentralized form thus allowing
                  this single Kalman filter to be decomposed into a
                  number of smaller communicating filters, each of
                  them processing local data for most of the time. The
                  resulting decentralized estimation scheme
                  constitutes a unique mean for fusing measurements
                  collected from a variety of sensors with minimal
                  communication and processing requirements. The
                  distributed localization algorithm is applied to a
                  group of 3 robots and the improvement in
                  localization accuracy is presented. Finally, a
                  comparison to the equivalent distributed information

                  yielded a class of interest-point-based features
                  that are stable under significant changes in scale,
                  viewpoint, and illumination, making them ideally
                  suited to landmark-based navigation. Although many
                  such features may be visible in a given view of the
                  robot? environment, only a few such features are
                  necessary to estimate the robot? position and
                  orientation. In this paper, we address the problem
                  of automatically selecting, from the entire set of
                  features visible in the robot? environment, the
                  minimum (optimal) set by which the robot can
                  navigate its environment. Specifically, we decompose
                  the world into a small number of maximally sized
                  regions, such that at each position in a given
                  region, the same small set of features is
                  visible. We introduce a novel graph theoretic
                  formulation of the problem, and prove that it is
                  NP-complete. Next, we introduce a number of
                  approximation algorithms and evaluate them on both
                  synthetic and real data. Finally, we use the
                  decompositions from the real image data to measure
                  the localization performance versus the undecomposed

                  of the elements contributing to nat- uralness of
                  synthetic scenes. In many image analysis and
                  interpretation applications, shadows interfere with
                  fundamental tasks such as object extraction and
                  description. For this reason, shadow segmentation is
                  an important step in image analysis. In this paper,
                  we propose a new cast shadow segmentation algorithm
                  for both still and moving images. The proposed
                  technique exploits spectral and geometrical
                  properties of shadows in a scene to perform this
                  task. The presence of a shadow is first hypothesized
                  with an initial and simple evidence based on the
                  fact that shadows darken the surface which they are
                  cast upon. The validity of detected regions as
                  shadows is further verified by making use of more
                  complex hypotheses on color invariance and geometric
                  properties of shadows. Finally, an information
                  integration stage confirms or rejects the initial
                  hypothesis for every detected region. Simulation
                  results show that the proposed algorithm is robust
                  and efficient in detecting shadows for a large class
                  of scenes.},

                  (3-D) maps of unmodified environments. In this
                  paper, we examine global localization, where the
                  robot localizes itself globally, without any prior
                  location estimate. This is achieved by matching
                  distinctive visual landmarks in the current frame to
                  a database map. A Hough transform approach and a
                  RANSAC approach for global localization are
                  compared, showing that RANSAC is much more efficient
                  for matching specific features, but much worse for
                  matching nonspecific features. Moreover, robust
                  global localization can be achieved by matching a
                  small submap of the local region built from multiple

                  Watson suggested I give a talk expositing Dempster's
                  work on upper and lower probabilities to the
                  Department of Statistics at Princeton. This essay is
                  one of the results of the ensuing effort. It offers
                  a reinterpretation of Dempster's work, a
                  reinterpretation that identifies his "lower
                  probabilities" as epistemic probabilities or degrees
                  of belief, takes the rule for combining such degrees
                  of belief as fundamental, and abandons the idea that
                  they arise as lower bounds over classes of Bayesian
                  probabilities.},

                  computation of marginal probabilities for when the

                  form and the sets of variables involved in the
                  factors form a hypertree. Previous expositions of
                  such local computation have emphasized conditional
                  probability. We believe this emphasis is
                  misplaced. What is essential to local computation is
                  a factorization. It is not essential that this
                  factorization be interpreted in terms of conditional
                  probabilities. The account given here avoids the
                  divisions required by conditional probabilities and
                  generalizes readily to alternative measures of

                  particularly useful for representing the topology of

                  maps can theoretically be learned using the
                  Baum-Welch algorithm, without strong prior
                  constraint on the structure of the model it is slow
                  to converge, requires a great deal of data, and is
                  often stuck in local minima. In this paper, we
                  consider a special case of hidden Markov models for
                  robot-navigation environments, in which states are
                  associated with points in a metric configuration

                  its configurations. Such odometry is typically not
                  precise enough to suffice for building a global map,
                  but it does give valuable local information about
                  relations between adjacent states. We present an
                  extension of the Baum-Welch algorithm that takes
                  advantage of this local odometric information,

                  of a set of images taken around the same viewpoint,

                  given a sequence of images acquired from
                  well-separated locations, how can they be arranged
                  to best explain their genesis? The solution to this
                  problem can be viewed as an instance of robot
                  mapping although it can also be used in other
                  contexts. We examine the problem where only limited
                  prior odometric information is available, employing
                  a feature-based method derived from a probabilistic
                  pose estimation framework. Initially, a set of
                  visual features is selected from the images and
                  correspondences are found across the ensemble. The
                  images are then localized by first assembling the
                  small subset of images for which odometric
                  confidence is high, and sequentially inserting the
                  remaining images, localizing each against the
                  previous estimates, and taking advantage of any
                  priors that are available. We present experimental
                  results validating the approach, and demonstrating
                  metrically and topologically accurate results over
                  two large image ensembles. Finally, we discuss the

                  contribution of our work is a fully automatic
                  mapping system that operates without the use of
                  active ranger sensors (such as laser or sonic
                  transducers), can operate in real-time and can
                  consistently produce accurate maps of large-scale
                  environments. Our approach implements a Rao-
                  Blackwellised particle filter (RBPF) to solve the
                  simultaneous localization and mapping problem and
                  uses efficient data structures for real-time data
                  association, mapping, and spatial reasoning. We
                  employ a hybrid map representation that infers 3D
                  point landmarks from image features to achieve
                  precise localization, coupled with occupancy grids
                  for safe navigation. This paper describes our
                  framework and implementation, and presents our

                  domain, attention has shifted to implementing SLAM
                  solutions using vision-based sensing. This paper
                  presents and analyses different models of the
                  Rao-Blackwellised particle filter (RBPF) for
                  vision-based SLAM within a comprehensive application
                  architecture. The main contributions of our work are
                  the introduction of a new robot motion model
                  utilizing structure from motion (SFM) methods and a
                  novel mixture proposal distribution that combines
                  local and global pose estimation. In addition, we
                  compare these under a wide variety of operating
                  modalities, including monocular sensing and the
                  standard odometry-based methods. We also present a

                  tracking applications is commonplace when a prior

                  tracking in real-time is much more difficult. We

                  observations of landmarks, the estimates of these
                  landmarks are all necessarily correlated with each
                  other because of the common error in estimated
                  vehicle location [27]. The implication of this was
                  profound: A consistent full solution to the combined
                  localisation and mapping problem would require a
                  joint state composed of the vehicle pose and every
                  landmark position, to be updated following each
                  landmark observation. In turn, this would require
                  the estimator to employ a huge state vector (of
                  order the number of landmarks maintained in the map)
                  with computation scaling as the square of the number

  abstract =	 {Visual SLAM is, in recent years, a very active
                  research area, the result of activities in the
                  convergence of the robotics and computer vision
                  communities. We present an overview of techniques,
                  from classical filtering to bundle adjustment
                  solutions, for both monocular and stereo (or
                  multicamera) systems, and emphasize that classical
                  SLAM solutions have been discarding precious sensory
                  information. In particular, the ability of vision to
                  sense objects at infinity should be exploited at its
                  maximum because it is precisely these remote objects
                  that will provide long-term, stable angular
                  references (in the way a compass would
                  do). Monocular SLAM systems have already solved this
                  issue, but stereo and multicamera systems have
                  not. We propose in these cases to use monocular SLAM
                  algorithms using fusion to incorporate all the
                  information. Numerous advantages like
                  desynchronization of the sensors firing, the
                  possibility of using several unequal cameras, or
                  selfcalibration, will naturally arise. We develop a
                  particular method for extrinsically decalibrated
                  stereo systems to illustrate the proposed ideas. We
                  evaluate the method with a real indoor experiment,
                  and highlight and discuss both its assets and
                  drawbacks.},

  abstract =	 {Recent eye tracking studies in natural tasks suggest
                  that there is a tight link between eye movements and
                  goal directed motor actions. However, most existing
                  models of human eye movements provide a bottom up
                  account that relates visual attention to attributes
                  of the visual scene. The purpose of this paper is to
                  introduce a new model of human eye movements that
                  directly ties eye movements to the ongoing demands
                  of behavior. The basic idea is that eye movements
                  serve to reduce uncertainty about environmental
                  variables that are task relevant. A value is
                  assigned to an eye movement by estimating the
                  expected cost of the uncertainty that will result if
                  the movement is not made. If there are several
                  candidate eye movements, the one with the highest
                  expected value is chosen. The model is illustrated
                  using a humanoid graphic figure that navigates on a
                  sidewalk in a virtual urban environment. Simulations
                  show our protocol is superior to a simple round

  abstract =	 {Humanoid robotics and SLAM (Simultaneous
                  Localisation and Mapping) are certainly two of the
                  most significant themes of the current worldwide
                  robotics research effort, bu tthe two fields have up
                  until now largely run independent parallel paths,
                  despite the obvious benefit to be gained in joining
                  the two. The next major step forward in humanoid
                  robotics will be increased autonomy, and the ability
                  of a robot to create its own world map on the fly
                  will be a significant enabling
                  technology. Meanwhile, SLAM techniques have found
                  most success with robot platforms and sensor
                  configurations which are outside of the humanoid
                  domain. Humanoid robots move with high linear and
                  angular accelarations in full 3D, and normally only
                  vision is available as an outward-looking
                  sensor. Building on recently published work on
                  monocular SLAM using vision, and on pattern
                  generation, we show that real-time SLAM for a
                  humanoid can indeed be achieved. Using HRP-2, we
                  present results in which a sparse 3D map of visual
                  landmarks is acquired on the fly using a single
                  camera and deonstrated loop closing and drift-free
                  3D motion estimation within a typical cluttered
                  indoor environment. This is achieved by tightly
                  coupling the pattern generator, the robot odometry
                  and inertial sensing to aid visual mapping within a
                  standard EKF framework. To our knowledge this is the
                  first implementation of real-time 3D SLAM for a
                  humanoid robot able to demonstrate loop closing.},

                  between an estimate of the image without moving

                  approaches to this problem differ in the type of
                  background model used and the procedure used to
                  update the model. This paper discusses modeling each
                  pixel as a mixture of Gaussians and using an on-line
                  approximation to update the model. The Gaussian
                  distributions of the adaptive mixture model are then
                  evaluated to determine which are most likely to

                  results in a stable, real-time outdoor tracker which

                  Clearly, this question is trivially answered if the
                  robots start at the same location. If their initial
                  location is unknown it creates a challenging data

                  demonstrate decentralized data fusion (DDF) and
                  simultaneous localization and map building (SLAM)
                  across multiple uninhabited air vehicles (UAVs). To
                  achieve this objective, the project specifies the
                  development of four UAVs, where each UAV houses up
                  to two terrain sensors and an INS/GPS navigation
                  system. The terrain sensors include a scanning
                  radar, laser/vision and standard vision system. The
                  DDF concept has to be shown to be effective both on
                  a single UAV and on multiple UAVs. The proof of the
                  concept will lie in the ability of the DDF structure
                  to conduct multi-target tracking problems as well as
                  SLAM. To obtain this goal, a number of subgoals are
                  required, most of which have never been attempted
                  before on a research level. The objective of this
                  paper is to present these goals as an overview of
                  the ANSER project along with some simulated and
                  real-time results.},

                  (elipses,rectangles) on the highway taped from the
                  airborne camera (with moving bg). They solve
                  tracking problem and appearance learning problem
                  together. The posterior in their problem is the
                  joint distribution on (pixel ownership
                  w.r.t. different layers) ,motion, shape, and
                  apperance over time. In their filtering step, they
                  deterministically update motion & shape parameters

                  ownerships and appearance pixel values with other

                  a generalized EM where each variables are updated

                  deterministically using searching procedure under
                  plannar motion assumption. One limitation with their
                  approach is that the step of computing the
                  pixel-ownership (masking) is rather limited to
                  certain simple shapes since their algorithm is not
                  very general, as pointed out by Jojic01cvpr. And
                  another limitation is that once the targets are lost
                  during the deterministic filtering steps, it can
                  hardly be recovered.. as they do not maintain
                  multiple hypothesis.}

                  task, a sequence of local maps of limited size is
                  built, and later joined together, to obtain the

                  building one global map from the beginning, as is it

                  an arbitrary vertex v \in V for which it sets a(v) =

                  is automatic understanding of events in a
                  site. Higher level processing on video data requires
                  certain lower level vision tasks to be
                  performed. One of these tasks is the segmentation of
                  video data into regions that correspond to objects
                  in the scene. Issues such as automation, noise
                  robustness, adaptation, and accuracy of the model
                  must be addressed. Current background modeling
                  techniques use heuristics to build a representation
                  of the background, while it would be desirable to
                  obtain the background model automatically. In order
                  to increase the accuracy of modeling it needs to
                  adapt to different parts of the same scene and
                  finally the model has to be robust to noise. The
                  building block of the model representation used in
                  this paper is multivariate non-parametric kernel
                  density estimation which builds a statistical model
                  for the background of the video scene based on the
                  probability density function of its pixels. A post
                  processing step is applied to the background model
                  to achieve the spatial consistency of the foreground
                  objects. },

                  localization. Compact 3D maps are generated using a

                  graphics literature, fed by data from a dual laser

                  online, while simultaneously accommodating errors in
                  their odometry. At the core of the algorithm is a
                  technique that combines fast maximum likelihood map
                  growing with a Monte Carlo localizer that uses
                  particle representations. The combination of both
                  yields an online algorithm that can cope with large
                  odometric errors typically found when mapping
                  environments with cycles. The algorithm can be
                  implemented distributedly on multiple robot
                  platforms, enabling a team of robots to
                  cooperatively generate a single map of their
                  environment. Finally, an extension is described for
                  acquiring three-dimensional maps, which capture the
                  structure and visual appearance of indoor
                  environments in 3D.},

                  problem. SLAM is the problem of acquiring a map of a
                  static environment with a mobile robot. The vast
                  majority of SLAM algorithms are based on the
                  extended Kalman filter (EKF). This paper advocates
                  an algorithm that relies on the dual of the EKF, the
                  extended information filter (EIF). We show that when
                  represented in the information form, map posteriors
                  are dominated by a small number of links that tie
                  together nearby features in the map. This insight is
                  developed into a sparse variant of the EIF, called
                  the sparse extended information filters
                  (SEIF). SEIFs represent maps by graphical networks
                  of features that are locally interconnected, where
                  links represent relative information between pairs

  Abstract =	 {Research on mobile robot navigation has produced two
                  major paradigms for mapping indoor environments:
                  grid-based and topological. While grid-based methods
                  produce accurate metric maps, their complexity often
                  prohibits efficient planning and problem solving in
                  large-scale indoor environments. Topological maps,
                  on the other hand, can be used much more
                  efficiently, yet accurate and consistent topological
                  maps are considerably difficult to learn in
                  large-scale environments. This paper describes an
                  approach that integrates both paradigms: grid-based
                  and topological. Grid-based maps are learned using
                  artificial neural networks and Bayesian
                  integration. Topological maps are generated on top
                  of the grid-based maps, by partitioning the latter
                  into coherent regions. By combining both
                  paradigms?rid-based and topological? the approach
                  presented here gains the best of both worlds:
                  accuracy/consistency and efficiency. The paper gives
                  results for autonomously operating a mobile robot

                  has received considerable attention in the mobile

                  be grouped into two distinct paradigms: topological

                  integrates both. It poses the mapping problem as a
                  statistical maximum likelihood problem, and devises
                  an efficient algorithm for search in likelihood
                  space. It presents an novel mapping algorithm that
                  integrates two phases: a topological and a metric
                  mapping phase. The topological mapping phase solves
                  a global position alignment problem between
                  potentially indistinguishable, significant
                  places. The subsequent metric mapping phase produces
                  a fine-grained metric map of the environment in

                  models and multiple cues. The background is modeled
                  by three Gaussian mixtures as in the work of
                  Stauffer and Grimson. Then the intensity and texture
                  information are integrated to remove shadows and to
                  enable the algorithm working for quick lighting
                  changes. For foreground analysis, the same Gaussian
                  mixture model is employed to detect the static
                  foreground regions without using any tracking or
                  motion information. Then the whole static regions
                  are pushed back to the background model to avoid a

                  fragmentation (one object becomes multiple

  Abstract =	 {Field-of-view (FOV) restrictions are known to affect
                  human behaviour and to degrade performance for a
                  range of different tasks. However, the relationship
                  between human locomotion performance in complex
                  environments and FOV size is currently not fully
                  known. This paper examined the effects of FOV
                  restrictions on the performance of participants
                  manoeuvring through an obstacle course with
                  horizontal and vertical barriers. All FOV
                  restrictions tested (the horizontal FOV was either
                  30? 75?or 120? while the vertical FOV was always 48?
                  significantly reduced performance compared to the
                  unrestricted condition. Both the time and the number
                  of footsteps needed to traverse the entire obstacle
                  course increased with a decreasing FOV size. The
                  relationship between FOV restriction and manoeuvring
                  performance that was determined can be used to
                  formulate requirements for FOV restricting devices
                  that are deployed to perform time-limited human
                  locomotion tasks in complex structured environments,

                  the pixel-level component performs Wiener filtering
                  to make probabilistic predictions of the expected
                  background; the region-level component fills in
                  homogeneous regions of foreground objects; and the
                  frame-level component detects sudden, global changes
                  in the image and swaps in better approximations of
                  the background. We compare our system with 8 other
                  background subtraction algorithms. Wallflower is
                  shown to outperform previous algorithms by handling
                  a greater set of the difficult situations that can
                  occur. Finally, we analyze the experimental results

                  approximations, updating and recursive methods;
                  gauge (datum) invariance; and quality control. The

                  and responds to unpredictable events in an unknown

                  expected. In the first part the author states that
                  methods of approximation are more laborious than
                  direct ones. Concerning the direct methods he shows
                  that most of them are applications of the
                  decomposition of the matrix $A$ into the product
                  $LDU$, where $L$ and $U$ are triangular matrices
                  with diagonal elements 1 and having elements not
                  equal to zero below or above the diagonal,
                  respectively, and $D$ is a diagonal matrix. He
                  proves that the decomposition is
                  unique. Applications of this are Gauss's elimination
                  method with the Jordan variant which the author
                  considers the best method for inverting $A$,
                  Choleski's method, Morris's escalator process and
                  Schmidt's orthogonalization. For each of these
                  methods the author measures the work of computation
                  by counting the number of multiplications and
                  recordings. },

                  information beyond the creation of the early
                  represcntations. A fundamental requirement at this
                  level is the capacity to establish visually abstract
                  shape properties and spatial relations. This
                  capacity plays a major role in object recognition,
                  visually guided manipulation, and more abstract
                  visual thinking. For the human visual system, the
                  perception of spatial properties and relations that
                  are complex from a computational standpoint,
                  nevertheless often appears immediate and
                  effortless. This apparent immediateness and ease of
                  perceiving spatial relations is, however,
                  deceiving. It conceals in fact a complex array of
                  processes highly specialized for the task. The
                  proficiency of the human system in analyzing spalial
                  information far surpasses the capacities of current
                  artificial systems. The study of the computations
                  that underlie this competence may therefore lead to
                  the development of new more efficient processors for
                  the spatial analysis of visual information. It is
                  suggested that the perception of spatial relations
                  is achieved by the application to the base
                  representations of visual routines that are composed
                  of sequences of elemental operations. Routines for
                  different properties and relations share elemental
                  operations. Using a fixed set of basic operations,
                  the visual system can assemble different routines to
                  extract an unbounded variety of shape properties and
                  spatial relations. At a more detailed level, a
                  number of plausible basic operations are suggested,
                  based primarily on their potential usefulness, and
                  supported in part by empirical evidence. The
                  operations discussed include shifting of the
                  processing focus, indexing to an odd-man-out
                  location, bounded activation, boundary tracing, and
                  marking. The problem of assembling such elemental
                  operations into meaningful visual routines is
                  discussed briefly.},

                  implications for the overall processing of visual
                  information. It is argued that the computation of
                  spatial relations divides the analysis of visual
                  information into 2 main stages: the bottom-up
                  creation of certain representations of the visible
                  environment and the application of visual routines,

                  representations constructed in the 1st stage.},

                  apparently effortless perceptual process of judging
                  whether a point is inside a closed curve. The
                  essential property of a routine was that it
                  instantiated a procedure as opposed to requiring a
                  specialized detector of some kind. For example,
                  seeing if two points are on the same contour can be
                  done using an operation such as tracing the
                  contour. A procedure such as this can cope with a
                  large variety of spatial relations and do so in a

                  to robot-companions. The future of robots, as our
                  companions, is highly dependent on their abilities
                  to understand, interpret and represent the
                  environment in an efficient and consistent fashion,
                  in a way that is comprehensible to humans. This
                  paper is oriented in this direction. It suggests a
                  hierarchical probabilistic representation of space
                  that is based on objects. A global topological
                  representation of places with object graphs serving
                  as local maps is suggested. Experiments on place
                  classification and place recognition are also
                  reported in order to demonstrate the applicability
                  of such a representation in the context of
                  understanding space and thereby performing spatial
                  cognition. Further, relevant results from user
                  studies validating the proposed representation are
                  also reported. Thus the theme of the work is
                  representation for spatial cognition.},

                  important role in mobile robotics as they support
                  various tasks such as motion control and accurate
                  localization. Popular approaches to represent the
                  geometric features of an environment are occupancy
                  grids or line models. Whereas occupancy grids
                  require a huge amount of memory and therefore do not
                  scale well with the size of the environment, line
                  models are unable to correctly represent corners or
                  connections between objects. In this paper we
                  present an algorithm that learns sets of polylines
                  from laser range scans. Starting with an initial set
                  of polylines generated from the range scans it
                  iteratively optimizes these polylines using the
                  Bayesian Information Criterion. During the
                  optimization process our algorithm utilizes
                  information about the angles between line segments
                  extracted from the original range scans. We present
                  experiments illustrating that our algorithm is able
                  to learn accurate and highly compact polyline maps
                  from laser range data obtained with mobile robots.},

                  spatial frequency, and motion can be understood from
                  the perspective of optimal information
                  transmission. The essence of the proposal is that
                  neural response properties at the system level
                  should be adjusted to the changing statistics of the
                  input so as to maximize information transmission. We
                  show that this principle accounts for several
                  well-documented psychophysical phenomena, including
                  the tilt aftereffect, change in contrast sensitivity
                  and post-adaptation changes in orientation
                  discrimination. Adaptation can also be considered on
                  a longer time scale, in the context of tailoring
                  response properties to natural scene
                  statistics. From the anisotropic distribution of
                  power in natural scenes, the proposal also predicts
                  differences in the contrast sensitivity function
                  across spatial frequency and orientation, including
                  the oblique effect.},

                  that makes use of a state vector consisting of
                  quantities that describes the relative locations
                  among features. In contrast to previous relative map
                  strategies, the new state vector is compact and
                  always consists of 2n-3 elements (in a 2-D
                  environment) where n is the number of features in
                  the map. It is also shown that the information from
                  observations can be transformed and grouped into two
                  parts: first one containing the information about
                  the map and the second one containing the
                  information about the robot location relative to the
                  features in the map. Therefore the SLAM can be
                  decoupled into two processes where mapping uses the
                  first part of the transformed observation vector and
                  localization becomes a 3-dimensional estimation
                  problem. It is also shown that the information
                  matrix of the map is exactly sparse, resulting in
                  potential computational savings when an information
                  filter is used for mapping. The new decoupled SLAM
                  algorithm is called D-SLAM and is illustrated using

                  reformulation of the simultaneous localization and
                  mapping (SLAM) problem for mobile robots such that
                  the mapping and localization can be treated as two
                  concurrent yet separated processes: DSLAM (decoupled
                  SLAM). It is shown that SLAM can be decoupled into
                  solving a nonlinear static estimation problem for
                  mapping and a lowdimensional dynamic estimation
                  problem for localization. The mapping problem can be
                  solved using an Extended Information Filter where
                  the information matrix is shown to be exactly
                  sparse. A significant saving in the computational
                  effort can be achieved for large scale problems by
                  exploiting the special properties of sparse
                  matrices. An important feature of DSLAM is that the
                  correlation among landmarks are still kept and it is
                  demonstrated that the uncertainty of the map
                  landmarks monotonically decrease. The algorithm is

                  image based localization in urban
                  environments. Given a database of views of city
                  street scenes tagged by GPS locations, the system
                  computes the GPS location of a novel query view. We
                  first use a wide-baseline matching technique based
                  on SIFT features to select the closest views in the
                  database. Often due to a large change of viewpoint
                  and presence of repetitive structures, a large
                  percentage of matches (> 50\%) are not correct
                  correspondences. The subsequent motion estimation
                  between the query view and the reference view, is
                  then handled by a novel and efficient robust
                  estimation technique capable of dealing with large
                  percentage of outliers. This stage is also
                  accompanied by a model selection step among the
                  fundamental matrix and the homography. Once the
                  motion between the closest reference views is
                  estimated, the location of the query view is then
                  obtained by triangulation of translation
                  directions. Approximate solutions for cases when
                  triangulation cannot be obtained reliably are also
                  described. The presented system is tested on the
                  dataset used in ICCV 2005 Computer Vision Contest

  abstract =	 {Iterative decoding techniques have become a viable
                  alternative for constructing high performance coding
                  systems. In particular, the recent success of turbo
                  codes indicates that performance close to the
                  Shannon limit may be achieved. In this thesis, it is
                  showed that many iterative decoding algorithms are
                  special cases of two generic algorithms, the min-sum
                  and sum-product algorithms, which also include
                  non-iterative algorithms such as Viterbi decod-
                  ing. The min-sum and sum-product algorithms are
                  developed and presented as generalized trellis
                  algorithms, where the time axis of the trellis is
                  replaced by an arbitrary graph, the "Tanner
                  graph". With cycle-free Tanner graphs, the resulting
                  decoding algorithms (e.g., Viterbi decoding) are
                  maximum-likelihood but suffer from an exponentially
                  increasing com- plexity. Iterative decoding occurs
                  when the Tanner graph has cycles (e.g., turbo
                  codes); the resulting algorithms are in general
                  suboptimal, but significant complexity reductions
                  are possible compared to the cycle-free
                  case. Several performance estimates for iterative
                  decod- ing are developed, including a generalization
                  of the union bound used with Viterbi decoding and a
                  characterization of errors that are uncorrectable

                  locomotion. They transform the retinal image from a
                  simple expanding pattern of moving texture elements
                  (pure optic flow), into a complex combination of
                  translation and rotation components (retinal
                  flow). In this article we investigate whether there
                  are measurable advantages to having an active free
                  gaze, over a static gaze or tracking gaze, when
                  steering along a winding path. We also examine
                  patterns of free gaze behavior to determine
                  preferred gaze strategies during active
                  locomotion. Participants were asked to steer along a
                  computer-simulated textured roadway with free gaze,
                  fixed gaze, or gaze tracking the center of the
                  roadway. Deviation of position from the center of
                  the road was recorded along with their point of
                  gaze. It was found that visually tracking the middle
                  of the road produced smaller steering errors than
                  for fixed gaze. Participants performed best at the
                  steering task when allowed to sample naturally from
                  the road ahead with free gaze. There was some
                  variation in the gaze strategies used, but sampling
                  was predominantly of areas proximal to the center of
                  the road. These results diverge from traditional

  abstract =	 {Monocular SLAM has the potential to turn inexpensive
                  cameras into powerful pose sensors for applications
                  such as robotics and augmented reality. However,
                  current implementations lack the robustness required
                  to be useful outside laboratory conditions: blur,
                  sudden motion and occlusion all cause tracking to
                  fail and corrupt the map. Here we present a system
                  which automatically detects and recovers from
                  tracking failure while preserving map integrity. By
                  extending recent advances in keypoint recognition
                  the system can quickly resume tracking -- i.e.\
                  within a single frame time of 33ms -- using any of
                  the features previously stored in the map. Extensive
                  tests show that the system can reliably generate
                  maps for long sequences even in the presence of
                  frequent tracking failure. },

                  visual SLAM (Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping)
                  system after tracking failure. The monocular SLAM
                  system stores the 3D locations of visual landmarks,
                  together with a local image patch. When the system
                  becomes lost, candidate matches are obtained using
                  correlation, then the pose of the camera is solved
                  via an efficient implementation of RANSAC using a
                  three-point-pose algorithm. We demonstrate the
                  usefulness of this method within visual SLAM: (i) we
                  show tracking can reliably resume after tracking
                  failure due to occlusions, motion blur or unmodelled
                  rapid motions; (ii) we show how the method can be
                  used as an adjunct for a proposal distribution in a
                  particle filter framework; (iii) during successful
                  tracking we use idle cycles to test if the current
                  map overlaps with a previouslybuilt map, and we
                  provide a solution to aligning the two maps by
                  splicing the camera trajectories in a consistent and
                  optimal way.},

                  detection based on the edge and region information

                  matching, and region growing. Finally, a post
                  processing procedure is used to eliminate noise and
                  tune the boundaries of the objects. Our approach can

  Abstract =	 {We describe an approach to recognizing location from
                  mobile devices using image-based Web search. We
                  demonstrate the usefulness of common image search
                  metrics applied on images captured with a
                  camera-equipped mobile device to find matching
                  images on the World Wide Web or other
                  general-purpose databases. Searching the entire Web
                  can be computationally overwhelming, so we devise a
                  hybrid image-and-keyword searching technique. First,
                  image-search is performed over images and links to
                  their source Web pages in a database that indexes
                  only a small fraction of the Web. Then, relevant
                  keywords on these Web pages are automatically
                  identified and submitted to an existing text-based
                  search engine (e.g. Google) that indexes a much
                  larger portion of the Web. Finally, the resulting
                  image set is filtered to retain images close to the
                  original query. It is thus possible to efficiently
                  search hundreds of millions of images that are not
                  only textually related but also visually
                  relevant. We demonstrate our approach on an
                  application allowing users to browse Web pages
                  matching the image of a nearby location.},

                  histogram and keyword search technique. However
                  global color histograms are not very discriminative

  abstract =	 {We propose a new incremental motion estimation
                  algorithm to deal with long image sequences. It
                  applies to a sliding window of triplets of images,
                  but unlike previous approaches, which rely on point
                  matches across three or more views, we also use
                  those points shared only by two views. This is
                  important because matches between two views are more
                  common than those across more views. The problem is
                  formulated as a series of local bundle adjustments
                  in such a way that the estimated camera motions in
                  the whole sequence are consistent with each
                  other. Two implementations are described. The first
                  is an exact one, which, based on the observation of
                  the sparse structure of the adjustment network,
                  embeds the optimization of 3D structure parameters
                  within the optimization of the camera pose
                  parameters. This optimization embedding considerably
                  reduces the minimization complexity. The second is a
                  mathematical procedure which transforms the original
                  problem involving both 3D structure and pose
                  parameters into a much smaller one, a minimization
                  over just the camera? pose parameters. This leads to
                  an even higher computational gain. Because we make
                  full use of local image information, our technique
                  is more accurate than previous incremental
                  techniques, and is very close to, and considerably
                  faster than, global bundle adjustment. Experiments
                  with both synthetic and real data have been
                  conducted to compare the proposed technique with
                  other techniques, and have shown our technique to be
                  clearly superior.},

                  processing and organizing spatially distributed,
                  multimodal sensor data in a sensor
                  network. Energy-constrained networked sensing
                  systems must rely on collaborative signal and
                  information processing (CSIP) to dynamically
                  allocate resources, maintain multiple sensing foci,
                  and attend to new stimuli of interest, all based on
                  task requirements and resource constraints. Target
                  tracking is an essential capability for sensor
                  networks and is used as a canonical problem for
                  studying information organization problems in
                  CSIP. After formulating a CSIP tracking problem in a
                  distributed constrained optimization framework, the
                  paper describes information-driven sensor query and
                  other techniques for tracking individual targets as
                  well as combinatorial tracking problems such as
                  counting targets. Results from simulations and
                  experimental implementations have demonstrated that
                  these information-based approaches are scalable and
                  make efficient use of scarce sensing and
                  communication resources.},

  abstract =	 {Our goal is to create a visual odometry system for
                  robots and wearable systems such that localization
                  accuracies of centimeters can be obtained for
                  hundreds of meters of distance traveled. Existing
                  systems have achieved approximately a 1\% to 5\%
                  localization error rate whereas our proposed system
                  achieves close to 0.1\% error rate, a ten-fold
                  reduction. Traditional visual odometry systems drift
                  over time as the frame-to-frame errors
                  accumulate. In this paper, we propose to improve
                  visual odometry using visual landmarks in the
                  scene. First, a dynamic local landmark tracking
                  technique is proposed to track a set of local
                  landmarks across image frames and select an optimal
                  set of tracked local landmarks for pose
                  computation. As a result, the error associated with
                  each pose computation is minimized to reduce the
                  drift significantly. Second, a global landmark based
                  drift correction technique is proposed to recognize
                  previously visited locations and use them to correct
                  drift accumulated during motion. At each visited
                  location along the route, a set of distinctive
                  visual landmarks is automatically extracted and
                  inserted into a landmark database dynamically. We
                  integrate the landmark based approach into a
                  navigation system with 2 stereo pairs and a low-cost
                  Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) for increased
                  robustness. We demonstrate that a real-time visual
                  odometry system using local and global landmarks can
                  precisely locate a user within 1 meter over 1000
                  meters in unknown indoor/outdoor environments with
                  challenging situations such as climbing stairs,
                  opening doors, moving foreground objects etc..},
