  Abstract =	 {Solving the SLAM problem is one way to enable a
                  robot to explore, map, and navigate in a previously
                  unknown environment. We investigate smoothing
                  approaches as a viable alternative to extended
                  Kalman filter-based solutions to the problem. In
                  particular, we look at approaches that factorize
                  either the associated information matrix or the
                  measurement matrix into square root form. Such
                  techniques have several significant advantages over
                  the EKF: they are faster yet exact, they can be used
                  in either batch or incremental mode, are better
                  equipped to deal with non-linear process and
                  measurement models, and yield the entire robot
                  trajectory, at lower cost. In addition, in an
                  indirect but dramatic way, column ordering
                  heuristics automatically exploit the locality
                  inherent in the geographic nature of the SLAM
                  problem. In this paper we present the theory
                  underlying these methods, an interpretation of
                  factorization in terms of the graphical model
                  associated with the SLAM problem, and simulation
                  results that underscore the potential of these
                  methods for use in practice.}
